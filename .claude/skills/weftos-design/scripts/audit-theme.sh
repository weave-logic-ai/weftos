# Audit the egui GUI crate for raw color literals that drift from
# docs/DESIGN.md §2 (the Tokens struct in
# crates/clawft-gui-egui/src/theming.rs).
#
# Rule:
#   D-TK01 : Color32::from_rgb / from_rgba_unmultiplied calls outside
#            theming.rs are flagged. Existing offenders are tracked
#            against a baseline file; the count can decrease (good)
#            but never increase (regression).
#
# Usage:
#   audit-theme.sh                             # report all offenders
#   audit-theme.sh --baseline <path>           # compare against baseline
#   audit-theme.sh [repo-root]                 # alternate root
#
# Exit 0 if (no offenders) OR (baseline supplied and count <= baseline).
# Non-zero if count > baseline OR baseline missing when requested.
