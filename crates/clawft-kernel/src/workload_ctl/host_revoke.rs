//! Forced unload on revocation: a node stops and unloads every instance it
//! hosts whose package, signer key or artifact hash was revoked (ADR-099
//! section 7, card mesh-placement-revoke).
//!
//! Revoking a subject drops its grants and evicts its bytes, but a cog that
//! is already running keeps running from what it loaded. This closes that:
//! when a revocation is applied (the operator's verb, a signed mesh notice,
//! or the daemon's start-up and 60 s sweeps, which catch one applied while the
//! node was down or whose teardown failed) the host walks
//! its instances and tears down each one that now names a revoked subject.
//! The teardown is not gated: the applied revocation is the authority, so
//! enforcement does not depend on the operator having written a stop permit.
//! Every step is chained (`workload.stop`, `workload.unload`, with
//! `forced_by_revocation` naming the subject).
