//! Node-local supervision of hosted instances (ADR-099 section 7): a
//! periodic health heartbeat whose meaning each kind defines, and bounded
//! restarts with backoff, every step chained.
//!
//! [`WorkloadHostService::supervise`] polls each instance that is meant to
//! run, once per its kind's interval. A kind's verdict
//! ([`crate::workload_kind::WorkloadKind::judge`]) counts a miss; enough
//! misses in a row make the instance `Unhealthy`, and the restart policy
//! then restarts it (stop, then start, both gated and chained by the
//! adapter host) until its budget inside the window is spent, at which
//! point it is `Failed` and held for the operator. An instance the
//! operator stopped, one that was never started and a finished one-shot run
//! are never restarted.
