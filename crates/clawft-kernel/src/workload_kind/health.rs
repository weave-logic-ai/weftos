//! Kind-defined instance health (ADR-099 section 7: "instance health from a
//! periodic status heartbeat whose meaning is kind-defined").
//!
//! A kind says how often its instances are polled, how many bad polls in a
//! row make one unhealthy, and how a status sample is judged. The sample is
//! deliberately small and runtime-agnostic (the adapter's `InstanceStatus`
//! is mapped onto it by the host), so a kind defines health without
//! depending on any adapter.
