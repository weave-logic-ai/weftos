//! Workload-kind registry (cog-boundary audit M3; ADR-099 section 2).
//!
//! A workload kind owns the pieces of the placement path that depend on
//! what is being placed: manifest body validation, how a verified package
//! becomes a [`WorkloadSpec`], and which adapter routes can run it. The
//! rest of the path (signature checks, seeding, gating, scoring, dispatch)
//! is kind-agnostic and looks the kind up here instead of assuming `cog`.
//!
//! Registration is explicit: [`KindRegistry::builtin`] builds a registry
//! holding the in-tree kinds (`cog`), and callers add more with
//! [`KindRegistry::register`]. There is no global mutable state.
