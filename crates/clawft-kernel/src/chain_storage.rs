//! Pin the chain storage location once at boot, and guard it with a lock.
//!
//! The kernel reads the chain checkpoint path in several places: boot
//! (signing key, RVF restore, tree checkpoint), the daemon's `chain.verify`
//! RPC, and shutdown persistence. [`pin_chain_storage`] resolves the path a
//! single time and writes it into the kernel config, so all of them agree
//! even if the environment changes after boot.
//!
//! Resolution, highest first:
//!
//! 1. an explicit `kernel.chain.checkpoint_path`;
//! 2. `chain.json` under the runtime root
//!    ([`clawft_types::runtime_paths::RuntimePaths`]: `$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`,
//!    else the project's `.weftos/runtime`, else legacy `~/.clawft`);
//! 3. a project root with no chain yet, while `~/.clawft/chain.*` exists
//!    (and no `--new-chain`): keep using the legacy chain and key. Booting a
//!    fresh genesis here would silently fork the operator's history, so the
//!    legacy chain stays in use (WARN) until `weaver migrate user-chain`
//!    (ADR-103 Phase 1) moves it.
//!
//! Once the legacy chain
//! carries a `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` marker, a boot that would still land on
//! it is refused (it would fork history) unless `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` isolates
//! it or `--adopt-legacy-chain` is passed (with a WARN).
//!
//! Whichever chain is in use is guarded by [`ChainLock`] (`chain.lock` beside
//! it) for the kernel's lifetime, so two kernels can never append to one
//! chain. In this crate's own unit tests the default is a fresh temp dir per
//! boot, so `cargo test` never touches the operator chain.
