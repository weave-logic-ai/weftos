//! Per-method capability gating for daemon RPC dispatch (WEFT-479).
//!
//! Today the daemon's UDS listener accepts every JSON-RPC verb from
//! every caller. There is no notion of "this caller may call
//! `kernel.shutdown` but not `agent.spawn`". This module is the
//! minimum honest gate: each method declares a required
//! [`Capability`], and an effective capability set is computed for
//! the caller (anonymous by default, escalated when a Bearer header
//! is presented and matches a token issued by the kernel's
//! [`AuthService`](clawft_kernel::AuthService)).
//!
//! # Capability classes
//!
//! - [`Capability::Read`] — read-only verbs that don't mutate state
//!   (`kernel.status`, `kernel.ps`, `agent.list`, ...). Anonymous
//!   callers always have this.
//! - [`Capability::Chat`] — conversational verbs that the LLM-side
//!   integration needs (`agent.chat`, `agent.chat.cancel`). Granted
//!   to anonymous callers by default; an operator can tighten this
//!   later by removing `Chat` from the anonymous baseline.
//! - [`Capability::Write`] — mutating verbs that change agent or
//!   substrate state (`agent.spawn`, `agent.stop`, `agent.send`,
//!   `memory.delete`, `substrate.publish`, ...). Requires
//!   authentication.
//! - [`Capability::Admin`] — destructive verbs that affect the
//!   daemon process itself (`kernel.shutdown`, `kernel.kill-process`,
//!   `kernel.restart-service`). Requires authentication AND the
//!   token's scope must include `admin`.
//!
//! # Posture
//!
//! Default-permissive on read; default-deny on admin. The
//! anonymous baseline includes `Read` and `Chat` (back-compat
//! posture for existing UDS callers). `Write` and `Admin` require an
//! authenticated token. The wire format adds an optional `auth`
//! field to the JSON-RPC request envelope; absent or empty `auth`
//! defaults to anonymous.
