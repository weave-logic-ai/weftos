//! Kernel daemon — persistent kernel process with local RPC transport.

//! The daemon boots a [`Kernel`], then listens for JSON-RPC requests on
//! the platform-local transport (WEFT-559):
//!
//! - **Unix**: Unix domain socket (`kernel.sock` under the runtime dir)
//! - **Windows**: named pipe `\\.\pipe\clawft-kernel-<hash>` derived from
//!   the same logical path via [`clawft_rpc::pipe_name_for_path`]
//!
//! The kernel itself is platform-agnostic and could also be wrapped in
//! WebSocket, TCP, or `postMessage` for other environments.
