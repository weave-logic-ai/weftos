//! Classifying a unix-socket peer of the user daemon (ADR-103 A14, review S9).
//!
//! ADR-070's local-owner shortcut honours a literal scope (`"admin"`) from any
//! peer with the daemon's uid. A supervised project kernel runs under that
//! uid, so a compromised child (or a tool its agents run) could send
//! `auth: "admin"`, mint an owner token and reach `project.revoke`,
//! `governance.parent.push` and the user chain.
//!
//! Children run in their own process group (`process_group(0)`, so the
//! group id is the child's pid) and so does everything they spawn, unless it
//! changes group itself. A same-uid peer whose process group is a supervised
//! child's is a [`PeerClass::Child`]: its literal scopes are ignored (it is
//! treated as anonymous, never refused outright, because a child legitimately
//! calls `kernel.handshake`, `mesh.*` and `project.anchor.submit`, which the
//! client library stamps with `"admin"` and which need only `read`), and only
//! its project token is honoured. The owner's own CLI is not in any child's
//! group and is unaffected.
//!
//! A same-uid peer whose pid or group cannot be determined is also a
//! [`PeerClass::Child`] (fail closed). The Windows named-pipe path and the
//! legacy `handle_connection` wrapper do not classify and default to
//! [`PeerClass::Owner`].
//!
//! Honest limit: this is a narrowing, not a boundary. A process that leaves
//! the group (`setsid`, `setpgid`) or double-forks away escapes it; the real
//! boundary is a separate uid or a sandbox (Phase 4). The peer pid comes from
//! the socket's peer credentials (`SO_PEERCRED` / `LOCAL_PEERPID`) and is
//! looked up once, at accept.
