//! The user-signed forward header (ADR-103 A6, Phase 2 package I).
//!
//! When the user daemon proxies a call to a project's own kernel it stamps
//! `Request.forward = {project_id, issued_at_ms, sig}`, signed by the user key
//! (the chain key of Phase 1 D-1) over the newline-joined fields
//! `"weftos-project-forward-v2\n"`, project id, `issued_at_ms`, method,
//! SHA-256 hex of the canonical params JSON, and the target child key id.
//! The header therefore authorises exactly one request to exactly one child:
//! reattached to another method, other params, or presented to a sibling
//! child, it fails. The child verifies it against the `user_pubkey` of its own
//! project certificate:
//!
//! * the signature must be the user key's (domain-tagged distinctly from the
//!   cert, anchor, PoP and chain-event bytes, so one key never signs
//!   confusable bytes);
//! * `project_id` must be the child's bound project, and the signed target
//!   key id the child's own (its node id, which is its project key id);
//! * the method and params must be those of the request carrying the header;
//! * `issued_at_ms` must lie within [`FORWARD_WINDOW_MS`] of the child's
//!   clock, in either direction (5 s);
//! * single use: a signature is accepted once; entries are kept for twice the
//!   window on a monotonic clock, so a wall-clock step cannot reopen a replay.
//!
//! [`ForwardVerifier`] is process state: the child installs it once at boot
//! with the cert's user key ([`install_trust`]); without it every forward
//! header is refused (`forward_unavailable`), never ignored. Forward headers
//! are honoured only from local unix callers: the TCP relay strips them
//! (`relay_auth::sanitize_line`).
//!
//! Honest limit: the header proves "the holder of the user key forwarded this
//! one request for this project". It does not prove who asked the user
//! daemon; that is the user daemon's own authorisation. A same-uid process
//! that can read the user key can sign one too; this is an isolation guard
//! between one user's projects, not a boundary against a hostile local
//! process (Phase 3 peer credentials, Phase 4 sandboxes).
