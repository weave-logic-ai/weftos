//! Daemon RPC extension seam (ADR-103 Phase 1, package D0).
//!
//! `daemon.rs` has one big `match` in `dispatch` and one choke point in
//! `dispatch_json_line`. Every package that adds RPC surface would collide
//! there, so new methods register here instead:
//!
//! * **Routes** ([`ExtRoute`]): a method prefix (`"project."`,
//!   `"auth.token."`) or an exact name (`"kernel.handshake"`) mapped to an
//!   async handler **and an explicit required [`Capability`]**. The
//!   capability table in `capability.rs` defaults unlisted methods to
//!   `Read` (anonymous-callable), so a route must state what it needs;
//!   [`authorize`] enforces it. A `None` from [`dispatch_ext`] means "not
//!   mine" and the legacy `match` runs.
//! * **Gates** ([`GateFn`]): hooks that see every authorized-so-far request
//!   and may deny it with a structured error (`error_kind` set). They run
//!   *after* capability resolution and receive the resolved capabilities,
//!   so a gate never sees a request from a caller who failed the
//!   capability check (no pre-auth existence leaks). Package G's D12 scope
//!   gate lands here.
//!
//! Every entry path (JSON lines, RVF frames, the in-process voice
//! consumer) builds a [`CallerCtx`] and goes through [`authorize`] in
//! `daemon.rs`, so there is one place where authorization happens.
//!
//! Ext routes cannot override the streaming intercepts in
//! `dispatch_json_line` (`ipc.subscribe_stream`, `substrate.subscribe`,
//! `kernel.logs_stream`): those take over the connection and are matched
//! before routes are consulted. They are still authorized and gated.
//!
//! A route whose prefix covers an intercepted method would change that
//! method's required capability while its handler never runs, so routes
//! must not cover them (a test asserts this for `ROUTES`).
//!
//! There is no transport marker: the TCP relay forwards into the unix
//! socket, so a relayed caller looks like a local one and no gate may rely
//! on the difference. Instead the relay (`relay_auth`) strips self-asserted
//! literal scope strings from relayed requests, and the daemon honours
//! literal scopes only from a unix peer with its own uid
//! ([`CallerCtx::peer_untrusted`]). Token secrets work on any path.
//!
//! Registration is explicit and stateless: the `ROUTES` and `GATES` const
//! tables below, one line per package. There is no global mutable
//! registry; handlers reach shared state through [`ExtCtx::kernel`].
//! Tests build their own [`ExtRegistry`] and use the `*_with` entry points.
