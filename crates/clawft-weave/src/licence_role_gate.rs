//! The licence verbs are machine-level, served by the licence holder only
//! (ADR-106 phase 3, board card e5e20dfc).
//!
//! The Seed licence path (checkouts, approvals, the binding, the clock floor)
//! belongs to the machine, not to a user or a project. In service mode
//! (ADR-103) the machine's licence path runs in exactly one daemon: the one
//! that holds the mesh service's reserved licence topics, the cluster
//! owner's. A collapsed daemon is its own machine and serves them too.
//!
//! This gate runs before the scope gate. On any other daemon it refuses
//! every licence verb with the reason, the holder (uid and user, as the
//! mesh service names it) and the command to run there. Nothing is
//! forwarded: an Admin token on one user's daemon is no authority on the
//! owner's, and reaching the owner's socket would need a new cross-user
//! trust path. `workload.node.binding` is the exception: it answers (with
//! the same redirect) so `weaver workload node status` and `weaver doctor`
//! show where the licence path is.
//!
//! The scope gate lets these verbs through outside a project on the daemon
//! that serves them (Read ones to anyone, Admin ones to Admin, as the
//! capability table says): they are mesh-wide by design and part of no
//! project.
