//! Workshop — config-driven, hot-reload UI composition.
//!
//! Spec: `.planning/ontology/ADOPTION.md` §8 Step 3 and
//! `.planning/explorer/PHASE-2-PLAN.md` §6 Track 5.
//!
//! ## What it is
//!
//! A Workshop is a composition primitive: a JSON value, stored at
//! `substrate/ui/workshop/<name>`, that describes a layout of child
//! panels. Each child panel names a substrate path whose value is
//! rendered with the existing shape-dispatched viewer registry
//! ([`crate::explorer::viewers::dispatch`]).
//!
//! The whole point of this primitive is that iterating on the
//! composition happens via substrate **publish**, not GUI rebuild. A
//! new Workshop value replaces the [`WorkshopView`] state on the next
//! frame and the layout re-renders.
//!
//! ## Schema
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "title": "Mic diagnostic",
//!   "layout": "rows",
//!   "params": { "node": "n-6f3a9c" },
//!   "panels": [
//!     {
//!       "title": "RMS gauge",
//!       "substrate_path": "substrate/sensor/mic",
//!       "viewer_hint": "auto",
//!       "min_height": 120
//!     },
//!     {
//!       "title": "Per-node mic",
//!       "substrate_path_template": "substrate/${node}/sensor/mic"
//!     }
//!   ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! * `title` — optional string; rendered as the Workshop heading.
//! * `layout` — one of `rows` (default), `grid`, `tabs`. All three are
//!   implemented (`grid` paints an `egui::Grid`, `tabs` paints a
//!   selectable tab bar). Unknown layouts round-trip through
//!   [`WorkshopLayout::Unknown`] and degrade to rows.
//! * `panels` — ordered array of [`WorkshopPanel`]s. Each panel must
//!   resolve to a substrate path: either supply `substrate_path`
//!   directly, or supply `substrate_path_template` (with `${param}`
//!   placeholders) plus the top-level `params` map.
//! * `params` — optional `{ name: string }` map. Values substitute
//!   into every panel's `substrate_path_template` via `${name}`. A
//!   placeholder with no matching param parses successfully but the
//!   panel renders a small "missing param `<name>`" hint at paint
//!   time. [WEFT-274]
//! * `viewer_hint` — explicit viewer override. `"auto"` (or unset) is
//!   shape-dispatched via [`super::viewers::dispatch`]; any other value
//!   that names a registered viewer ([`viewer_for_hint`]) routes the
//!   panel through that viewer directly. Unknown hints fall back to
//!   shape-dispatch with a small debug hint so the writer can see
//!   their hint didn't match. [WEFT-280]
//!
//! ## Hot-reload mechanism
//!
//! 1. User (or a file-watcher, or a script, or an LLM) publishes a new
//!    Workshop JSON value to `substrate/ui/workshop/<name>`.
//! 2. The Explorer's existing `SELECT_POLL` re-read fetches the new
//!    value into `Explorer::selected_value`.
//! 3. [`WorkshopView::paint`] parses the value afresh each frame — the
//!    `Workshop` struct is never cached across frames, so a published
//!    change takes effect in the very next paint.
//! 4. The child-panel poller ([`WorkshopView`]) diffs its tracked path
//!    set against the newly-parsed panel list; stale subscriptions are
//!    dropped, new ones start on the next tick.
//!
//! No reload, no rebuild, no explicit subscription handshake — the
//! substrate poll cascade handles it.
