//! Ontology Explorer — left-tree / right-detail panel for walking the
//! substrate namespace live. Spec: `.planning/explorer/PROJECT-PLAN.md`.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - [`Explorer`] owns panel state: expansion set, selection, cached
//!   tree children, per-path activity timestamps, and the RPC
//!   subscription lifecycle.
//! - Tree expansion fires `substrate.list { prefix, depth: 1 }` via
//!   [`Live::submit`](crate::live::Live::submit) and caches the result.
//! - Selection fires `substrate.read` for the selected path, with a
//!   slow re-poll so the viewer updates in near-real-time. When
//!   selection changes, the prior poll handle is dropped — the next
//!   tick simply reads the new path.
//!
//! Graceful degradation: if `substrate.list` comes back with
//! "method not allowed" (backend worker hasn't landed the RPC yet),
//! the tree renders just the virtual root and shows a small
//! backend-unavailable hint. No synthetic in-memory children.
