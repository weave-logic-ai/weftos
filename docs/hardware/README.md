# Hardware knowledge base — WeftOS / WeaveLogic

A living inventory of the hardware our cogs, sensors, Fleet nodes, and placement targets run on —
what each part *is*, how we use it, its gotchas, and a cited source. Public facts only (no appliance
credentials or partner-confidential details).

Two layers:
- **Knowledge** (these files) — what a part is + our usage + gotchas. Written by research sub-agents.
- **Procurement** (planned) — real part numbers, price, and stock pulled from a distributor API
  (Mouser, or Nexar/Octopart for Arrow). Lands alongside these as `*-catalog.*`.

A local **RVF `hardware` brain** indexes these files for semantic search (ruv stack, on-machine — no
signup). Rebuild it after editing a file or after a catalog pull.

## Catalog: hardware -> software link

`crates/weftos-cog-market/catalog/catalog.json` is the typed catalog the console and dashboard read
(Projects -> Modules -> Chips). A module links to the software that drives it with `cogs: [<cog id>]`,
and may carry `firmware` facts (`version`, `read_with`, `read_config_key`, `update`, `url`, `notes`;
empty = unknown) and `docs: [{label, url}]` (`url` is a web link or a repo path). Availability and
install state are never stored here; the console joins the link with the marketplace and the host.
See [ADR-107](../adr/adr-107-catalog-hardware-software-link.md). `HwCatalog::validate()` (run by the
crate tests) checks the link shape.

## Cross-cutting findings (load-bearing)

- **Arch is per-target, from the userland not the kernel.** cog0's Pi 5 has an aarch64 kernel but an
  **armhf userland** → cogs + host build armv7/armhf there. Pi Zero 2 W is armv7l. Build per target.
- **x86 Xeon box has no AVX2** → SIGILL risk for AVX2-assuming builds; target generic/Westmere.
- **ESP32 Fleet constraints**: Xtensa PSRAM-atomics landmine (S2/S3; C3/C6 immune); OTA is a *hardware*
  decision (4 MB boards = single-app/no-OTA, N8R8 is OTA-capable); HIL needs USB-Serial/JTAG (absent on
  the S2); **ESP32-C6 has a native 802.15.4/Thread mesh radio** — relevant to the Fleet layer (COG-010).
- **AI TOPS are NOT cross-comparable**: DGX Spark = FP4, Jetson = sparse-INT8, Coral/Hailo = INT8.
  Compare on memory + precision + ecosystem, not a single TOPS number. DGX Spark power draw unconfirmed.
