# Leaf-push protocol

The wire protocol for **kernel → leaf** push operations: how the WeftOS
kernel (and the services running on it) drive display layers, audio, and
control on constrained "leaf" devices — a Tidbyt, an ESP32 touch panel,
and (by design) future formats like smart glasses, watches, phones, and
apps.

Shared schema crate: [`crates/weftos-leaf-types`](../crates/weftos-leaf-types/src/lib.rs)
(`no_std + alloc`, CBOR via `ciborium`, compiles for `xtensa-esp32-*`).
Both sides — kernel publisher and leaf firmware — depend on it so the
payload formats can't drift.

## 1. Roles

- **Leaf** — a constrained device with one or more *sinks* (a display,
  an audio output, compute). It announces what it can do, then receives
  push payloads and renders/plays them. It is a peer mesh node, not a
  dependent peripheral: it degrades gracefully when the mesh is
  unreachable (renders last-known state, keeps sensing).
- **Kernel / service** — the publisher side. A service holding state
  worth showing (`cluster`, `kernel.ps`, an agent, …) produces
  `LeafPush` payloads aimed at a leaf and publishes them to that leaf's
  push topic.

## 2. Topics

Per leaf, keyed by its Ed25519 pubkey (hex):

| Topic | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mesh.leaf.<pubkey_hex>.push` | kernel → leaf | `LeafPush` payloads |
| `mesh.leaf.<pubkey_hex>.announce` | leaf → kernel | `LeafServices` capability advertisement |

Helpers: `push_topic(pubkey_hex)` / `announce_topic(pubkey_hex)` in
`weftos-leaf-types`.

## 3. Transport

- **Mesh transport** — plaintext TCP to the daemon's `[kernel.mesh]`
  `listen_addr` (default `0.0.0.0:9470`) when `noise = false`. Noise-
  encrypted once leaf peers are provisioned with their own keys; for
  bring-up the config ships `noise = false` so leaf firmware can be
  brought up without the handshake first.
- **Framing** — `[4-byte big-endian length][payload]`.
- **Payload** (`noise = false`) — a UTF-8 JSON `MeshIpcEnvelope`:
  `{ source_node, dest_node, message, hop_count, envelope_id }`.
- A leaf **subscribes** by sending a `MeshIpcEnvelope` whose `message`
  targets `Topic("mesh.subscribe")` carrying the push topic it wants.
  The daemon then routes matching publishes to that connection.
- The `LeafPush` itself is **CBOR**, carried inside the envelope. The
  `weaver leaf push` path base64-wraps the CBOR in a small JSON message
  (`{ "type": "leaf_push", "cbor_b64": "...", "target_pubkey": "..." }`)
  and publishes via `ipc.publish` to the push topic; the topic router
  bridges that to the leaf's mesh-transport subscription.

## 4. Payloads — `LeafPush`

`#[non_exhaustive]` enum — new variants are additive, old leaves ignore
unknown variants.

| Variant | Payload |
|---|---|
| `DisplayText` | `z: LayerSlot`, `text` (soft cap 64), `x`, `y`, `color: [u8;3]`, `clear_first` |
| `DisplayImage` | `z: LayerSlot`, `rgb` (RGB888 row-major), `effect`, `alpha` |
| `DisplayClear` | `z: LayerSlot` |
| `DisplayBrightness` | `on_us: u32` (PWM on-time) |
| `LayerEffect` | `z: LayerSlot`, `effect: LayerEffectKind` |
| `Audio` | `AudioDrop` — `Chord` / `Scuttle` / `Pcm` |

### Display layers — `LayerSlot`

Z-ordered compositing slots: `Bg` < `Widget` < `Text` < `Alert`. A leaf
composites its layers bottom-up. Effects (`LayerEffectKind::Static {
keep_ratio }`) apply per layer.

## 5. Capability advertisement — `LeafServices`

A leaf announces, on its `.announce` topic:

```
LeafServices {
  node_pubkey: [u8; 32],
  hostname: String,
  firmware_version: String,
  audio_sink:   Option<AudioSinkCap>,    // sample_rate, channels, bit_depth, max_voices
  display_sink: Option<DisplaySinkCap>,  // width, height, pixel_format, layers, blend_modes
  compute:      Option<ComputeCap>,      // cpu_mhz, free_heap_bytes, eml_core
}
```

`DisplaySinkCap` is the **head profile** — it tells the publisher side
the exact geometry and capability of this head so a producer can design
content that fits. A 64×32 Tidbyt, an 800×480 ESP32 panel, a round
watch face, monocular glasses, and a phone app are all just different
`DisplaySinkCap` values.

## 6. REQUIREMENT (not yet built) — the `LeafRenderer` producer trait

> **Status: design requirement, captured here, not yet implemented.**
> Decision recorded 2026-05-14. The wire format (§4–§5) and the manual
> `weaver leaf push` CLI exist today; the producer-side trait below does
> not. First firmware bring-up uses `weaver leaf push` + a host script
> (see §7) — the trait is the "do it right" follow-up.

The missing half of the leaf abstraction is the **producer contract**:
the thing that turns a service's state into `LeafPush` operations for a
given head.

It should be a **first-class trait**, defined once in the leaf
abstraction (`weftos-leaf-types`, `std`-feature-gated — only the
publisher side needs it; the `no_std` leaf side only ever *receives*
`LeafPush`), and **implemented by each displayable service**. Not a
separate central "designer" process, and not ad-hoc per-service code —
a contract:

```rust
// weftos-leaf-types, behind the `std` feature
pub trait LeafRenderer {
    /// Given a target head's announced capabilities, produce the push
    /// operations that represent this service's current state.
    fn render(&self, profile: &DisplaySinkCap) -> Vec<LeafPush>;
}
```

Why a trait, why per-service, why in the leaf abstraction:

- **Rendering knowledge belongs with the data.** The `cluster` service
  knows how to represent cluster state better than any central designer
  could. Each service owns its own `render` impl.
- **It's a contract, not a convention.** A uniform interface means the
  kernel (or any orchestration) can drive *any* displayable service to
  *any* head without special-casing.
- **Format-extensibility is structural.** `render` takes a
  `DisplaySinkCap`. A new head format — glasses, watch, phone, app — is
  a new profile value, not a new code path. Services do responsive
  design against the profile (`if profile.width < 128 { terse } else {
  full }`); a new head needs zero service changes.
- **It belongs in the leaf abstraction** because the leaf protocol is
  what defines "what a head is" (`DisplaySinkCap`). The renderer trait
  is the other half of that same contract.

### Open sub-question (deferred)

Does `render` emit raw `LeafPush` ops, or an intermediate **design**
(layout intent) compiled to push-ops per profile? The intermediate-IR
form lets the head do final placement — better across wildly different
geometries — but is more machinery. v1 ships `render(profile) ->
Vec<LeafPush>`; a design-IR can be added later without breaking the
trait's callers.

This is a cross-crate architectural decision (it shapes
`weftos-leaf-types`, every displayable service, and the leaf firmware
contract) and should graduate to its own ADR when implemented.

## 7. The `LeafSurface` primitive — the leaf-side display bus

> **Status: design, agreed 2026-05-14 (three-expert team analysis).
> Crate `weftos-leaf-display` not yet built.**

`LeafRenderer` (§6) is the *publisher* contract: service state →
`LeafPush`. `LeafSurface` is its *leaf-side mirror*: the contract
between the leaf firmware's **compositor** (the code that turns
received `LeafPush` ops into pixels) and the **physical display bus**
(esp-hal DPI, a HUB75 RGB matrix, an SPI panel, a host simulator).

The reason it must exist: the first CrowPanel bring-up welded the
firmware directly to esp-hal's DMA/DPI calls. That produced a
fragile, esp-hal-specific path that broke (see §8). The primitive
seals the hardware bus behind one trait so the compositor and the
`LeafPush` dispatch are written **once**, against the abstraction.

```rust
// weftos-leaf-display, no_std
pub trait LeafSurface {
    /// Back buffer the compositor draws into — an
    /// `embedded_graphics::DrawTarget<Color = Rgb888>`.
    type Frame<'a>: DrawTarget<Color = Rgb888, Error = Self::Error>
    where Self: 'a;
    type Error: core::fmt::Debug;

    /// Self-description. Single source of truth for
    /// `LeafServices.display_sink` and every `LeafRenderer`.
    fn capability(&self) -> DisplaySinkCap;

    /// Borrow the back buffer; the compositor renders the full
    /// composited layer stack into it each frame.
    fn frame(&mut self) -> Self::Frame<'_>;

    /// Present the back buffer. Swap / DMA-kick / cache-flush / blit
    /// semantics are ENTIRELY the implementation's problem. Returns
    /// when it is safe to draw the next frame.
    fn present(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;

    /// Optional hardware brightness; default = graceful Unsupported,
    /// compositor falls back to pixel-level dimming.
    fn set_brightness(&mut self, _on_us: u32) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        Err(Self::Error::unsupported())
    }
}
```

What the primitive **promises** (every impl): an accurate
`DisplaySinkCap`, an `Rgb888` `DrawTarget` of `width×height`, and a
`present()` barrier that's safe to call in a loop. What it
**leaves to the impl**: buffer location (PSRAM / SRAM / host `Vec`),
double-buffering, DMA, cache coherency, blit. It deliberately does
*not* promise tearing-free, a fixed framerate, or partial updates —
those are quality-of-implementation.

The **layer compositor is a generic free function** in
`weftos-leaf-display`: it takes `&[Layer]` (the `LayerSlot` stack)
and any `LeafSurface`, folds `Bg → Alert` into `surface.frame()`,
calls `present()`. Z-ordering is solved once, generically.

### Implementations slot under it

| Impl | `capability()` | `frame()` | `present()` |
|---|---|---|---|
| esp-hal DPI (`clawft-edge-pad`) | const 800×480 | PSRAM framebuffer view | the §8 circular-chain + cache dance |
| HUB75 RGB matrix (Tidbyt) | 64×32 | small SRAM buffer | bit-bang / I²S the scan |
| SPI panel (watch) | e.g. 240×240 | line buffer | chunked SPI DMA; `set_brightness` = backlight PWM |
| host simulator (`std`, dev/CI) | configurable | `Vec<Rgb888>` | push to a window / dump PNG |

The host simulator is what makes the `LeafPush` render path
**testable with zero hardware** — build and verify the compositor
against it before the esp-hal impl exists.

### Crate placement

New `crates/weftos-leaf-display/` — `#![no_std]`, `alloc` always.
Depends on `weftos-leaf-types` (`DisplaySinkCap`, `LeafPush`,
`LayerSlot`) + `embedded-graphics-core`. **Not** folded into
`weftos-leaf-types` — that stays a pure, hardware-free wire-schema
crate. The `std` feature gates only the host simulator. Hardware
impls (esp-hal DPI) live in their *own* crates and depend on
`weftos-leaf-display` — the abstraction crate never imports esp-hal.

`DisplaySinkCap` is the shared pivot: `LeafSurface::capability()`
*produces* it (firmware builds `LeafServices.display_sink` straight
from it — no hand-written announce), `LeafRenderer::render()`
*consumes* it.

## 8. Implementing `LeafSurface` for a scanned RGB panel

The CrowPanel esp-hal `LeafSurface::present()` must port a proven
pattern. Root cause of the first failed attempt + the references
(three-expert team, 2026-05-14):

**Why the naive attempt failed.** esp-hal 1.0's `DmaTxBuf` over a
linear PSRAM `Vec` *compiles and the DPI scans* — but it is **not a
frame-coherent path**:

1. `DmaTxBuf` is **one-shot, non-circular** — its descriptor chain
   ends in a single `suc_eof`; the GDMA stops there while the DPI
   peripheral free-runs its raster from its own timing registers →
   FIFO underrun → everything past the consumed bytes is black. The
   day-2 `dma_loop_buffer!` "worked" *only* because `DmaLoopBuf` is
   **circular** (and DRAM-only, ~4 KB — useless for a 768 KB frame).
2. Cache: `rom_Cache_WriteBack_Addr` flushes *resident dirty cache
   lines* — it is not a RAM→PSRAM copy. A 768 KB CPU fill through a
   32 KB write-back dcache leaves most of the framebuffer never
   written to PSRAM; only the resident tail survives.

**The proven pattern** (ESP-IDF `esp_lcd_panel_rgb` "Mode A";
LovyanGFX `Bus_RGB`, which drives this exact CrowPanel):

1. Framebuffer in PSRAM, **aligned to the GDMA external-memory /
   cache-line constraint**, width padded to a 4-byte multiple.
2. A **hand-built circular descriptor chain** spanning the whole
   framebuffer (~190 descriptors at ≤4032-byte chunks; the **last
   descriptor's `next` points back to the first**). The GDMA
   auto-rescans every VSYNC with no CPU intervention. esp-hal 1.0
   has **no buffer type** that is PSRAM-backed *and* large *and*
   looping — so this is a custom `DmaTxBuffer` impl, porting Mode A
   into Rust.
3. **Explicit dcache writeback of the framebuffer** after
   compositing, before the GDMA reads it (ESP-IDF's `esp_cache_msync`
   pattern; the ROM `rom_Cache_WriteBack_Addr` is the esp-hal-side
   primitive).
4. **Fallback — bounce buffers ("Mode B")**: two internal-SRAM
   buffers ping-pong (PSRAM→SRAM copy→LCD). This sidesteps the cache
   problem entirely (the GDMA only ever reads coherent SRAM) and is
   the recommended path at higher pixel clocks. The CrowPanel's
   ~16 MHz clock makes direct Mode A acceptable if (2) and (3) are
   correct; Mode B is the robust escape hatch.

All of the above lives **inside one `LeafSurface::present()` impl**.
Nothing above the trait sees a descriptor, a cache line, or a DMA
channel.

### Bring-up path

1. **`weftos-leaf-display`** — the `LeafSurface` trait + the generic
   layer compositor + the `std` host-simulator impl. Pure software,
   testable on the host.
2. **`LeafPush` render path** — the compositor mapping `LeafPush` →
   `LayerSlot` layers → `LeafSurface`. Verified on the simulator
   before any hardware impl exists.
3. **esp-hal `LeafSurface` impl** (§8) — the circular PSRAM chain +
   cache writeback, sealed in `present()`.
4. **Leaf firmware** (`crates/clawft-edge-pad`) — WiFi, mesh
   subscribe to `mesh.leaf.<pubkey>.push`, CBOR-decode `LeafPush`,
   feed the compositor + the esp-hal `LeafSurface`.
5. **Host push** — `scripts/leaf-push-ps.sh` already pushes
   `kernel.ps` rows; proves the channel end-to-end before the
   `LeafRenderer` trait (§6) exists.
