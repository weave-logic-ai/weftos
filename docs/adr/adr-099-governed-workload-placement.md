# ADR-099: Governed workload placement across the mesh

- **Status**: Accepted (2026-09-29; decisions settled 2026-09-29, implementation tracked on cards mesh-placement-01..23)
- **Date**: 2026-09-28 (rewritten same day; supersedes the earlier draft titled "Cog workloads and mesh placement", which is now ADR-100 plus this ADR)
- **Deciders**: Platform / ops. Open questions settled 2026-09-29 (defaults accepted by user); status stays Proposed until implemented, but the decisions below are settled pending implementation.
- **Depends-On**: ADR-022 (mandatory ExoChain audit), ADR-024 (Noise), ADR-025 (Ed25519 node identity), ADR-031 (rvf-wire mesh format), ADR-033 (three-branch governance), ADR-092 (governance rule distribution), ADR-094 (spawn permission)
- **Relates-To**: ADR-100 (cog workload kind), ADR-101 (inference workload kind), ADR-060 / ADR-018 (local model serving, which ADR-101 migrates), ADR-044 (wasip2), `~/llm` ADR-0004 (open capability vocabulary), 0016 (local serving), 0022 (storage tiers)
- **Amends**: none. Fills the reserved `SpawnBackend::Remote / Container / Wasm` slots (`crates/clawft-kernel/src/supervisor.rs:298-322`). No earlier ADR covers workload placement or remote backends (searched `docs/adr`, `docs/architecture`, `.planning`; `docs/architecture/swarm-topology.md` covers claude-flow prompt roles and the flat `SwarmCoordinator`, not node placement).

## Context

Three requirements arrived together:

1. Run Cognitum "cogs" (native ARM binaries) as governed, loadable workloads placed on the right node: a Mac for development, preferably a Cognitum Seed/Zero, Pi 5, or ARM server added to the mesh.
2. "The same for NPU workloads, or TPU, or even a TSU if we had one": accelerators are first-class placement targets.
3. "This really should be the same way local inference is hosted long term": model servers (today `llama-server` on :8090, Ollama on :11434, controlled from `~/llm`) become placed workloads.

Placement therefore cannot be a cog feature. It is a general layer; cogs and inference servers are two **workload kinds** on it, and future accelerator jobs are more. This ADR defines the layer. Kind-specific decisions are in ADR-100 (cogs) and ADR-101 (inference).

### What the WeftOS mesh gives us today (verified in source)

| Need | What exists | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Node identity | `NodeIdentity`: Ed25519, `node_id = hex(SHA-256(pubkey)[..16])` (`cluster.rs:305-352`, ADR-025). `NodeRegistry` maps node id to pubkey and holds derived write grants (`node_registry.rs:96-131`). | none |
| Join / trust | Noise-encrypted mesh; `WeftHandshake` carries `node_id`, `governance_genesis_hash`, `governance_version`, a `u32` capability bitmap, `chain_seq` (`mesh.rs:124-146`). Operator pairing window / `PairingGate` (`cluster.rs:1094`, `:1168`). `RevocationList` is a persisted host ban list checked in `add_peer_checked` (`cluster.rs:864-878`, `revocation.rs`). | Revocation bans hosts only: no package, signer, or artifact revocation. |
| Discovery | `DiscoverySource` SeedPeer / Mdns / Kademlia / PeerExchange / Manual (`mesh_discovery.rs:37-50`); `MeshPeerEvent` feeds `ClusterMembership` (`mesh_discovery.rs:58`, `cluster.rs:896`). | none |
| Capability advertisement | `PeerNode { platform, state, address, capabilities: Vec<String>, labels }` (`cluster.rs:87-117`). `NodePlatform` is `CloudNative / Edge / Browser / Wasi / Custom` (`cluster.rs:29-40`): no CPU arch, OS, runtime, accelerator, memory, or feed. Capability tokens are a **closed** allow-list, Ed25519-signed (`capability_claim.rs:23-38`, `:109-198`). `labels` say "for scheduling" but are unsigned and unused. `NodeEccCapability` (`cluster.rs:281`) is tick timing only. Only one place reads host arch (`tools_extended.rs:716`). A repo grep for Metal/CoreML/CUDA/NPU/Hailo/Coral in `clawft-kernel` and `clawft-types` finds nothing. | No hardware or accelerator advertisement; vocabulary is closed. |
| Remote RPC | `MeshIpcEnvelope` carries a `KernelMessage` (hop count, dedup id, JSON default) (`mesh_ipc.rs:40-100`); `MessageTarget::RemoteNode` routing (`mesh_runtime.rs:326-345`, `:458-477`); correlated `MeshRequest` (`mesh_ipc.rs:224`). | Message plane exists; no workload-control message set. |
| Remote spawn | `SpawnBackend::Remote { node_id }` returns `BackendNotAvailable` "requires K6"; `Container` and `Wasm` likewise (`supervisor.rs:661-682`). | Unimplemented. |
| Health | SWIM-style `HeartbeatTracker` Alive / Suspect / Dead (`mesh_heartbeat.rs:216-227`, `:299-380`). | Node-level only; no workload health, restart, or reschedule. |
| Artifact transfer | `ArtifactStore` (BLAKE3, `artifact_store.rs`); frame types 0x0B / 0x0C (`mesh_framing.rs:51-54`); `ArtifactExchange` request / response / announcement types (`mesh_artifact.rs:17-63`). | `ArtifactExchange` is types plus a test catalog; its doc says real integration is not done (`mesh_artifact.rs:58-62`); no other crate uses it. One `Vec<u8>` per response: unusable for multi-GB model weights. |
| Placement / scheduling | `ConsistentHashRing`, `DistributedProcessTable`, `ProcessAdvertisement`, `ResourceSummary`, gossip / consensus scaffolding (`mesh_process.rs:22-345`); `ClusterServiceRegistry` (`mesh_service_adv.rs:16-60`). | Defined and re-exported (`lib.rs`, `weftos/src/lib.rs`) but referenced by no other crate: no placement decision exists. `ResourceSummary` is usage, not capacity. |
| App lifecycle | `AppManifest` (`app.rs:41-79`); install gated with action `app.install` (`app.rs:627`); chain kinds `app.install` / `app.start` (`chain.rs:459-465`); `weaver app` CLI calls `app.install/start/stop/remove/list/inspect` (`clawft-weave/src/commands/app_cmd.rs:54-120`). | Daemon `dispatch` (`clawft-weave/src/daemon.rs:5863-6380`; has `cluster.*`, `node.*`, `agent.register`) contains no `app.*` arm; repo-wide grep finds `"app.install"` only in the CLI, `app.rs`, `chain.rs`. Needs confirmation by running a daemon. |
| Container backend | `ContainerManager::start_container` is simulated (`container.rs:383-405`). | No real runtime. |
| Governance | `GateBackend::check(agent_id, action, context)`; `CapabilityGate` permits unknown actions (`gate.rs:111-135`); `GovernanceGate` over `EffectVector` (`gate.rs:297-420`); rule distribution per ADR-092. | New `workload.*` actions would be **permitted** by default; need explicit default-deny. |
| Signed installs | none: install checks the gate only. | Add signature and hash verification. |
| Existing service model | The local LLM is already a kernel service `llm` with lifecycle flag, health check, and a chain-anchored contract (`clawft-weave/src/llm_service.rs`, header). | Single-node, points at a hardcoded URL. |

Summary: identity, encrypted join, discovery, node health, message routing, content-addressed storage, governance and audit exist. **Hardware and accelerator advertisement, an open vocabulary, a placement decision, remote workload control, real container and native runtimes, signature verification, large-artifact transfer, and (probably) the daemon `app.*` handlers do not.**

## Decision

Introduce a **governed workload placement layer** with five parts: a generic workload model, an open capability vocabulary with node advertisement, a placement engine, a runtime-adapter trait, and a mesh lifecycle. Every placement, install, load, start, unload, migration, and refusal is gated by governance and written to ExoChain.

### 1. Workload model

A **workload** is `(kind, spec, package/manifest, config, requirements, policy)`:

- `kind` is an open string (`cog`, `inference`, later `accelerator-job`, `wasm-module`). Each kind is defined in its own ADR and supplies: how a spec becomes requirements, which adapters may run it, what "healthy" means, and its stable-address behavior.
- `requirements` are expressed only in the capability vocabulary (section 2). The placement engine never contains kind-specific logic.
- The payload is content-addressed in `ArtifactStore`: a **manifest artifact** (small, signed) that lists content hashes of the actual payload files or shards. Small payloads (cog binaries) are fetched whole; large ones (model weights) are addressed by shard and may be **adopted in place** (section 6).
- Instance identity: `instance_id = (manifest hash, config hash, node id)`. Secrets are delivered over Noise at place time and never written to chain payloads (hash only).

A workload is not an `AppManifest` agent. An optional wrapper lets `weaver app list` show workloads, but the manifest artifact is the source of truth.

### 2. Open capability vocabulary and node advertisement

**Capabilities are not an enum.** A capability is a dotted, lowercase id plus attributes:

```
Capability { id: "accel.gpu.metal", attrs: {vendor, device, sdk, sdk_version, mem_bytes, mem_free_bytes,
                                            unified, formats[], precisions[], ...},
             provenance: claimed | probed | measured,
             state: available | busy | reserved | degraded,
             exclusive: bool }
Requirement { id | id_prefix, where: [eq|gte|lte|in|has on attrs], count, exclusive }
```

Rules that make it extensible without a kernel change:

1. A node advertises whatever ids its probes and adapters produce. A requirement matches a node iff the node advertises that exact id (or an id under the requested prefix) and all predicates pass. Unknown ids are carried, stored, and matched; the placer does not need to understand them.
2. A **vocabulary file** (`config/capabilities.toml`) lists well-known ids and their attribute schemas. It drives validation warnings, `weaver workload explain` output, and docs. It **does not gate**: an id not in the file is accepted. Experimental ids use the `x.` prefix.
3. The signed allow-list in `capability_claim.rs:23-38` stays for the coarse existing tokens. Node facts are a new signed block in the same format. The closed list is not extended per accelerator.
4. `provenance` is honest: `probed` means a local probe saw it; `measured` means a conformance or benchmark run produced it; `claimed` is operator- or adapter-asserted. This follows `~/llm` ADR-0004, which says a claimed capability must be measured before it is trusted. Placement may require `probed` or better.

Initial well-known ids (all data, none code):

| Family | Ids |
|---|---|
| CPU / OS | `cpu.arch.aarch64`, `cpu.arch.armv7`, `cpu.arch.x86_64`, `os.linux`, `os.macos` |
| Runtimes | `runtime.native`, `runtime.container.apple`, `runtime.container.docker` (attr `variant`: orbstack, engine, desktop), `runtime.container.podman`, `runtime.wasm.wasmtime`, `runtime.infer.llamacpp`, `runtime.infer.mlx-lm`, `runtime.infer.ollama`; each with attrs `arches_native[]`, `arches_emulated[]` |
| Accelerators | `accel.gpu.metal`, `accel.gpu.cuda`, `accel.gpu.rocm`, `accel.gpu.vulkan`, `accel.npu.ane`, `accel.npu.hailo`, `accel.npu.rknn`, `accel.npu.qualcomm`, `accel.tpu.coral`, `accel.tpu.cloud`, `accel.tsu.<vendor>`, `accel.other.<name>` |
| Model / data formats | `format.gguf`, `format.mlx`, `format.safetensors`, `format.onnx`, `format.tflite`, `format.coreml`, `format.hef` (as attrs on accelerators and runtimes, and as ids so a requirement can name them) |
| Memory | `mem.system` (attrs total, free), `mem.unified` (marks that GPU and NPU share the system pool, so a placer must not double-count), `mem.vram` |
| Feeds / data | `feed.esp32-csi-udp` (attr `lan_id`, `bind`), `feed.http-sensor`, `store.tier.internal`, `store.tier.external` (attr `mounted`), `model.present` (list of shard hashes held) |
| Trust / class | `trust.tier.{discovered,paired,pinned}`, `node.class.{dev-mac,cognitum-seed,pi5,arm-server,other}` (informational) |

Probing is a `node_facts` module run at boot and on change. It reads `std::env::consts`, `sysctl`/`/proc`, and shells to `docker info`, `container --version`, `podman info`, `ollama`/`llama-server` presence, binfmt/qemu for emulation, and vendor tools where present (e.g. `nvidia-smi`, `hailortcli`). It never assumes: an accelerator is advertised only if a probe confirms it. On this Mac (M5 Max, 128 GB, Metal 4, 40 GPU cores, verified with `sysctl` and `system_profiler` on 2026-09-28) the probe would emit `accel.gpu.metal` with `unified = true` and `mem.unified`. The Apple Neural Engine has no public direct-query API and is reachable only through CoreML; the probe can infer its presence from the chip and CoreML availability, but **busy state and throughput cannot be read**, so ANE is advertised as `claimed` or `probed` at most and marked `state: available` without utilisation until measured.

**Measured throughput, not only architecture.** NodeFacts also carries `perf.*` capabilities with `provenance: measured`: for cogs, `perf.cog.cycle_ms{cog_id}` (wall time of one `--once`/`--interval 1` cycle on a reference feed); for inference, `perf.infer.tok_s{model}` and prefill rate; for accelerators, per-format throughput. The conformance harness (card 08) and admission probes populate them. The motivating measurement (real hardware, 2026-09-29): the same cog at `--interval 1` takes about 6 s per cycle on a Pi Zero 2 W and about 1 s on a Pi 5, a 6x difference between two nodes that both advertise `cpu.arch.aarch64`/`armv7` and pass every hard constraint. Architecture alone cannot rank them. On identical synthetic input, fall-detect on a Cognitum Seed (armhf) and on the Pi 5 (aarch64 native) produced the same `z_impact` to the last digit printed (0.7071067811865475 versus ...476), so measured cycle time is a valid ranking signal without correctness caveats between those arches.

Advertisements are signed by the node key (proves who said it, not that it is true), carry a TTL, and are refreshed on change. A node's state (`busy`, free memory) is a small delta message on top of the signed base.

### 3. Placement

A placement request is `(workload, config, pins/affinity, allow_emulated?)`. The engine is a **pure function** `place(request, node_facts[], cluster_state) -> Decision` so it is table-testable; I/O lives in the control plane.

**Phase A, hard constraints** (a node failing any is filtered, with the failing constraint recorded):
1. Requirements from the workload kind are satisfied by advertised capabilities (arch, runtime, accelerator class and format, memory / VRAM including model size plus KV budget, exclusive access).
2. `hardware_requirement` and resource asks from the manifest.
3. Data locality constraints the kind declares (sensor LAN `lan_id`; for inference, only a **preference**, see ADR-101).
4. Trust tier at least what the package policy requires; provenance at least what the requirement requires.
5. Node `Alive`, not revoked, facts within TTL.
6. **Co-residency**: the workload's `excludes` list (for example two large model servers that must not share a memory pool, as in `~/llm` docs) against instances already on the node.
7. **Governance**: `gate.check(requester, "workload.place", ctx)` permits.

**Phase B, preference scoring** among survivors: native on real target hardware, then emulated, then the dev-mac fallback, as strict tiers (example weights 100 / 40 / 20, tunable; a lower tier never outranks a higher one). This was decided by the user on 2026-09-29: ARM workloads must run on the real ARM node, such as the Pi, and a native run on the dev Mac is only a last-resort fallback, never preferred over target hardware. The earlier example weights (100 / 20 / 40) contradicted the stated order and were wrong. Verification follows the same rule: anything that must prove it runs on ARM is tested on the Pi through `scripts/build.sh test-pi`; data locality (feed on the same LAN, weights already present, consumer proximity); accelerator fit (prefer the smallest sufficient accelerator, never steal an `exclusive` one); **measured performance** (for workloads declaring `latency_class = interactive` or a cycle-time budget, a node whose measured `perf.*` misses the budget is filtered, and among passers a lower measured cycle time scores higher; nodes with no measurement are scored conservatively and flagged); load; stickiness to the current node. Weights are placeholders in governance config, not fixed by this ADR.

**Overrides and fallback.** Operator pins and affinity override scoring, not constraints; a pin to an ineligible node is a hard error naming the failed constraint. **Emulated placement is allowed only as an explicit fallback** (`allow_emulated`), recorded as `emulated: true` in the chain event. A workload with no eligible node is reported `Unplaceable` with per-node reasons, never silently degraded.

**Verification of claims.** The target node runs an admission self-check (binary arch, runtime dry-run, free memory, accelerator device open) and refuses on disagreement; the refusal is chained and the placer tries the next candidate. Conformance runs can upgrade a capability's provenance to `measured`.

**Validated on hardware (2026-09-29).** The native ARM path is proven on a Pi 5 that already runs weaver v0.8.1 as a mesh member: released aarch64 cogs `anomaly-detect`, `fall-detect`, `baby-cry` and `sleep-apnea` ingest natively there. A Cognitum Seed was driven successfully through its own HTTP API (ADR-100 section 5). Placement itself is still unimplemented; these results validate the target nodes and the native adapter's premise, not the layer.

### 4. Governance

Actions: `workload.install`, `workload.place`, `workload.load`, `workload.start`, `workload.unload`, `workload.migrate`, all with `kind` in context and an `EffectVector` (package trust, node trust tier, network policy, secrets present, emulated, accelerator use, resource cost). Because `CapabilityGate` permits unknown actions (`gate.rs:111-135`, test `capability_gate_unknown_action_permits`), the governance rule set must ship an explicit default-deny for the `workload.*` prefix (distributed per ADR-092). Decisions, permitted or denied, are chained.

### 5. Runtime adapters

```rust
trait WorkloadRuntime {
    fn id(&self) -> &str;                              // "native", "container.apple", "container.docker", "infer.llamacpp", ...
    fn provides(&self) -> Vec<Capability>;             // what a node advertises when this adapter works
    async fn admit(&self, w: &VerifiedWorkload) -> Result<Admission>;   // self-check, reserves resources
    async fn load(&self, w: &VerifiedWorkload, cfg: &Config) -> Result<InstanceHandle>;
    async fn start(&self, h: &InstanceHandle) -> Result<()>;
    async fn stop(&self, h: &InstanceHandle, grace: Duration) -> Result<Evidence>;
    async fn unload(&self, h: InstanceHandle) -> Result<()>;
    async fn status(&self, h: &InstanceHandle) -> InstanceStatus;   // includes kind-specific health
    fn control_mode(&self) -> ControlMode;             // Managed | Adopted (observe-only)
}
```

Adapters: `native` process (cog-runner-style limits, later landlock / seccomp), `container.*` (apple-container, docker/OrbStack, podman), `wasm` (later; **decided 2026-09-29: unify on `clawft-wasm-host`** and retire or wrap the kernel `wasm_runner` module for cogs, so there is one WASM sandbox and one permission store), a **`remote.api`** family for nodes that expose their own management API instead of running WeftOS (the Cognitum Seed, ADR-100), and **inference-server** adapters (`infer.llamacpp`, `infer.mlx-lm`, `infer.ollama`) that wrap a server process or an already-running server. Accelerator-specific adapters (Hailo HEF runner, Coral TFLite delegate, RKNN, Qualcomm, TSU) implement the same trait and simply add their capability ids. **`ControlMode::Adopted`** lets the layer register and health-check a server the operator started by hand (as today) without controlling it, which is the first migration step for inference.

Accelerator job kinds and the TPU / TSU / NPU adapters are **deferred until the hardware exists**; the vocabulary and trait ship now.

### 6. Artifacts and large payloads

- The manifest lists `{path, size, blake3, shard_index}`. Large files are split into fixed-size pieces (proposal 64 MiB) with a piece-hash list.
- **Swarm distribution (decided 2026-09-29).** Artifacts spread across the mesh the way a torrent does, though it doesn't have to be BitTorrent itself. The design has three parts:
  - **Identity.** An artifact is identified by its content (the root hash over the piece list), not by the node it came from. Any node that holds verified pieces can serve them.
  - **Exchange.** Nodes announce what they hold with a `have` bitfield, request individual pieces, and verify each piece's hash before accepting it. A node that finishes a download becomes a seeder.
  - **Swarm behaviour.** Nodes fetch different pieces from several peers at once, prefer the rarest pieces, and choose peers by locality and measured link speed (NodeFacts). A seeder dropping out mid-transfer only means re-requesting its pieces from another peer.
- **The work is split across two cards.** Card 11 builds the simple node-to-node version, on the swarm-ready protocol above. It is content-addressed and piece-based, resumes from the `have` bitfield, and can fetch from any holder, not only the node the artifact came from. Card 25 extends it:
  - multi-source parallel fetch and rarest-first;
  - seeding, and reseeding after a fetch;
  - a cache with pinning and eviction policy, advertising held artifacts as capabilities;
  - bandwidth limits;
  - reliability when seeders drop out.

  `ArtifactExchange` is finished on this basis (today it is scaffolding).
- **Governance of distribution.** Only artifacts whose signed manifest verifies may be seeded or cached. Revocation of a package id, signer or artifact hash stops seeding it and evicts it from caches everywhere, and every seed, evict and revoke action is chained. Transfer outcomes are chained as well: each completed or failed fetch (`artifact.fetch`), each rejected piece and the peer that sent it (`artifact.piece_rejected`), and the first time an artifact is served to each peer (`artifact.serve`). Individual piece transfers are not chained, because they would flood the chain.
- **Adopt in place**: a node may hash existing local files (for example an HF cache or Ollama blob store) and register them as artifacts without copying, so 20 GB of weights already on a node is never re-shipped. Adoption is recorded and the file is re-hashed lazily on use.
- **Locality-aware fetch**: nodes advertise `model.present` (shard hashes held) and `store.tier.*` (with `mounted`). The placer prefers a node that already holds the payload; if none does, it chooses between fetching from a peer and placing where the bytes are, using size versus link estimate, and records the choice.
- Signatures cover the manifest (hashes of everything), not the bytes; verification checks each shard hash on arrival or on adoption.

### 7. Mesh lifecycle

State machine per instance: `Requested -> Placed -> Fetching -> Verified -> Loaded -> Running -> (Stopping -> Unloaded | Failed | Lost)`.

- **Control plane**: a `workload.ctl` message set (place, load, start, stop, unload, status, logs) over `MeshIpcEnvelope` / `MeshRequest`, addressed to the node's `workload-host` service (advertised through `ServiceAdvertisement`). Messages are signed and carry the governance decision id and a nonce with expiry.
- **Health**: node liveness from `HeartbeatTracker`; instance health from a periodic status heartbeat whose meaning is kind-defined (cog: last ingest; inference: `/health` and `/v1/models`).
- **Restart**: node-local supervisor with bounded backoff, each restart chained.
- **Reschedule on node loss**: instances of a `Dead` node become `Lost`; the placer re-runs placement excluding the dead node (stickiness off) subject to governance, unless the instance is `pinned` or the kind declares itself non-migratable (inference with warm KV, see ADR-101), in which case it raises an alert.
- **Revocation**: extend `RevocationList` to package ids, signer keys, and artifact hashes. A revocation is a chained, gossiped event; nodes check at fetch and on receipt, stop and unload affected instances, and reconcile on rejoin via `chain_seq`.
- **Audit**: every transition, placement decision (candidates, scores, failed constraints), governance decision, refusal, and revocation is an ExoChain event (ADR-022): new kinds `workload.install / place / load / start / stop / unload / migrate / refuse / revoke` next to `chain.rs:459-465`.

### 8. Trust (Decided 2026-09-29, defaults accepted by user)

1. Package and manifest signatures are Ed25519 (ADR-025) from a **pinned WeftOS signer set plus operator-pinned keys** in governance config (ADR-092). Rationale: one anchor we control, rotated through the existing governance distribution. At least one valid signature from a pinned signer is required to install or place. ML-DSA-65 dual signing (ADR-028) is a follow-up.
2. Kind-specific external verifiers (Cognitum release records for cogs) are optional additional signatures (ADR-100). **Model trust is operator attestation over a hash manifest** (ADR-101), because upstream publishers of weights rarely sign.
3. Node trust tiers gate what may run there: `discovered` nothing by default; `paired` operator-signed workloads; `pinned` workloads that carry secrets.
4. Commercial terms (Cognitum's 30% per cog) are **contractual, not enforced in code**. Rationale: enforcement code is not a substitute for the agreement.
5. Our cogs fork is the source of truth and is ahead of upstream until our PRs merge (ADR-100).

### 9. Security and deferred

Threat model: malicious package, lying node advertisement, node that ignores unload, replayed control message, LAN attackers (the ESP32 UDP feed is unauthenticated). Mitigations in v1: signature and hash checks before execution, governance on every action, unprivileged and container isolation, signed control messages, per-instance tokens, secrets over Noise only, revocation with forced unload. Known limits: node facts are self-reported (admission self-check and conformance runs reduce, not remove, this); a compromised node key can lie; native isolation is weak until landlock / seccomp.

Deferred: WASM lane; landlock / seccomp; cross-LAN sensor relay; armv7 on Apple `container` (unsupported by that runtime); ML-DSA dual signing; hardware attestation; TEE backend; NPU / TPU / TSU hardware adapters (until the devices exist); cost-based bin-packing (this is constraints plus scoring, not a general scheduler).

## Consequences

Positive: one layer serves cogs, model servers, and future accelerator jobs; new accelerator classes need a vocabulary entry and an adapter, not a kernel change; governance and audit are uniform; local inference gains failover and locality; most mesh plumbing is reused.

Cost: finishing scaffolding (`ArtifactExchange`, placement state, container runtime), adding signature verification, a new signed advertisement, a control message set, probably the daemon RPC handlers.

Risks: scope creep into a general scheduler (mitigation: pure constraint plus score function, no preemption or bin-packing); advertisement drift (TTL, admission self-check); vocabulary sprawl (mitigation: the vocabulary file is advisory and reviewed like any config); wrong unified-memory accounting (mitigation: `mem.unified` marks a shared pool).

## Decisions (settled 2026-09-29, defaults accepted by user)

1. **Trust anchor**: pinned WeftOS Ed25519 signer set plus operator-pinned keys; Cognitum release records optional (section 8). Rationale: single controlled anchor.
2. **RPC family**: a new `workload.*` RPC family, not reuse of `app.*`. Rationale: workloads are not kernel-spawned agents. Card 06 still confirms the suspected missing `app.*` daemon handlers.
   - **Confirmed 2026-09-29 (card mesh-placement-06)**: against a running daemon built from `dc9c7ea2`, every `weaver app list|inspect|start|stop|remove|install` returned `unknown method: app.*`; the gap was real. The daemon now routes `app.*` to the kernel `AppManager` behind the governance gate (`clawft-weave/src/app_rpc.rs`) and serves `workload.list|inspect|install|unload` from a node-local catalog (`clawft-weave/src/workload_rpc.rs`). `workload.*` mutations fail closed without a gate and chain `workload.install` / `workload.unload` / `workload.refuse`; `workload.revoke` and `workload.node.bind` are Admin, the other lifecycle verbs Write, and an unclassified `workload.*` verb defaults to Write (`capability.rs`). `place`, `load`, `start`, `stop` and `migrate` answer "not available on this node" until cards 09 and 12 land. `weaver app list` still shows apps only; the wrapper that lists workloads there (section 1) has not been built.
3. **Emulation**: operator opt-in only, never automatic. Rationale: emulated results and timing are misleading, and the choice must be visible and chained.
4. **WASM stack**: unify on `clawft-wasm-host`; retire or wrap the kernel `wasm_runner` for cogs. Rationale: one sandbox, one permission store.
5. **Adopt-in-place and weight transfer**: no hard transfer-size ceiling in v1; adopt-in-place is allowed on removable drives, and a detached drive marks the workload Degraded (never silently broken). Chunk size 64 MiB remains a tunable placeholder.
6. **Vocabulary file** (`config/capabilities.toml`): changed only through the governance path, not freely editable. It remains advisory (does not gate matching).
7. Other decisions on inference (proxy, `~/llm`, exposure, first slice) are recorded in ADR-101; cog scope and Seed strategy in ADR-100.
