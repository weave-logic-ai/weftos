## Cog Records (COG-NNN)

Records that define a cog, or the cog workload kind, use their own COG-NNN series so they stay out of the main ADR numbering. ADR-100 is intentionally unused, because COG-001 was first drafted under that number.

| COG | Title | Status | Category | Source |
|-----|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| [COG-001](cog-001-cog-workload-kind.md) | The cog workload kind (package, host contract, ingest bridge, Seed strategy) | Accepted | Architecture / Integration | Cognitum cogs; ADR-099 |
