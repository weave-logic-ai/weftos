# WeftOS Deployment Standard Operating Procedures

Version: 1.1.0
Effective: 2026-04-02
Updated: 2026-10-02
Applies to: the 0.8.x tree (checked against `weaver` built at c9e8f86b3)
Checked against the CLI and config schema: SOP 1, SOP 3 Steps 1-3, the systemd
example in [agents.md](./agents.md). SOP 2, 4, 5 and SOP 3 Steps 4-5 still use
the original 0.3.1 command names and have not been re-verified.

## Overview

This document defines the standard operating procedures for deploying WeftOS as
a cross-project coordination layer. It was developed against two real
WeaveLogic properties -- weavelogic.ai (B2B consulting site) and
weftos.weavelogic.ai (open-source docs site) -- and is intended as a reusable
template for every client engagement.

Each SOP is self-contained with prerequisites, step-by-step procedures, expected
outputs, quality gates, and known limitations.

## SOP 1: Adding WeftOS to an Existing Project

### Purpose and Scope

Establish a WeftOS runtime instance within an existing software project so that
the kernel can boot, agents can execute, and the ECC knowledge graph can begin
population. This SOP covers initial installation through first successful kernel
boot.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| WeftOS daemon CLI (`weaver`) | Built from this tree (`scripts/build.sh native`) or installed from a release, and on PATH. Every command in SOP 1 and SOP 3 is a `weaver` command; `weft` has no `init` or `kernel` subcommand (`weft --help`; `weft onboard` initializes clawft config and workspace, not a WeftOS project) |
| Rust toolchain | Only if building from source; see `rust-toolchain.toml` |
| Project VCS | Git repository with at least one commit |
| Permissions | Write access to project root directory |
| Network | Outbound HTTPS for LLM providers (optional for offline/local inference) |

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Run `weaver init` from the project root

```bash
cd /path/to/project
weaver init --yes
```

`weaver init` (`crates/clawft-weave/src/commands/init_cmd.rs`) creates:

- `weave.toml` at the project root. It refuses to overwrite an existing one
  (`--force` overwrites, `--update` keeps it and only seeds missing files).
- `.weftos/runtime/`, the runtime root of a kernel started inside this project
  (socket `kernel.sock`, `kernel.pid`, `kernel.log`, `kernel.lock`, the node key
  and the chain checkpoint; see `crates/clawft-types/src/runtime_paths.rs`).
  `weaver init` writes nothing else under `.weftos/`; the kernel creates the
  rest.
- `graphify-out/`, the output directory of `weaver graphify` / `weaver topology`.
- `.gitignore` entries for `.weftos/` and `graphify-out/` (the file is created
  when absent).
- `.clawft/SOUL.md`, `.clawft/IDENTITY.md` and `.clawft/SOUL.journal.md`, the
  agent identity files (see [agents.md](./agents.md)).

The generated `weave.toml` sets `kernel.max_processes = 64` and
`kernel.health_check_interval_secs = 30`, plus `[domain]`, `[tick]`,
`[sources.files]` and `[embedding]` sections. Flags: `--name`, `--mesh` (adds a
`[kernel.mesh]` block, see SOP 3), `--ecc` (adds `[kernel.ecc]`), `--force`,
`--update`, `--yes`.

#### Step 2: Configure `weave.toml` for the specific project

The daemon reads `weave.toml` from its working directory and layers the JSON
config (`~/.clawft/config.json`) over it
(`crates/clawft-platform/src/config_loader.rs`). It deserializes the result into
`Config`, whose top-level keys are `agents`, `channels`, `providers`, `gateway`,
`tools`, `delegation`, `routing`, `agent_routing`, `voice`, `kernel`, `pipeline`,
`plugins` and `skills` (`CONFIG_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS`,
`crates/clawft-types/src/config/mod.rs`). Unknown keys are ignored. That
includes `[domain]`, `[tick]`, `[sources.*]` and `[embedding]` as `weaver init`
writes them: they are not `Config` fields, so editing them does not change how
the daemon boots. The `[kernel]` keys it does read are in `KernelConfig`
(`crates/clawft-types/src/config/kernel.rs`). The ones SOP 1 needs:

```toml
[kernel]
max_processes = 32               # default 64 (kernel.rs:10-12)
health_check_interval_secs = 60  # default 30 (kernel.rs:15-17)
```

`weaver kernel status` echoes both values back as `Max procs` and `Health chk`.

#### Step 3: Start the kernel

```bash
weaver kernel start
```

`weaver kernel start` backgrounds the daemon by default. Add `--foreground` to
keep it in the terminal or to run it under a service manager (a unit must use
`--foreground`; see [agents.md](./agents.md)). There is no `daemon`
subcommand and no `boot` action.

Beside a running user daemon, a plain `weaver kernel start` inside a project is
refused unless `--legacy-project-daemon` is passed (ADR-103 A7); the supported
path there is `weaver kernel start --project <id|name>`.

Embedding models are not downloaded by the CLI: there is no
`--download-models` flag. `[embedding]` in `weave.toml` is not a daemon `Config` field
(Step 2).

The daemon opens the IPC socket for CLI communication; the boot log is written
to `kernel.log` in the runtime root, and `weaver kernel logs` or
`weaver kernel attach` shows it.

#### Step 4: Verify the installation

```bash
weaver kernel status
```

Prints `State:      running`, the `Processes:` and `Services:` counts, `Max procs`,
`Health chk`, `Socket`, `Log`, the `Node:` id and a `Mesh:` line (`off` unless
`[kernel.mesh]` is enabled). A freshly started kernel with no agents reported
`Processes:  1` when checked on this tree.

```bash
weaver kernel services
```

Prints a table (Name, Type, Health, Detail). A default start with no mesh listed
`ecc.hnsw`, `assessment`, `cluster`, `agent.chat`, `cron`, `ecc.cognitive_tick`,
`llm` and `containers`; `llm` reports `unhealthy` when no LLM endpoint
answers. There is no separate ExoChain service entry. Stop with
`weaver kernel stop`.

If no daemon is running, `kernel status` and `kernel services` boot a throwaway
kernel and say so (`no daemon running — booting ephemeral kernel`); that output
does not verify a started daemon.


#### Optional: machine mesh service

When the machine mesh service runs (`weaver mesh serve`, or the installed unit),
check it and pin its key once. `weaver mesh trust` prints the fingerprint and pins
the key in the same invocation, with no confirmation prompt
(`crates/clawft-weave/src/commands/mesh_cmd.rs`, `trust`), so compare first: the
`machine key` fingerprint and public key shown by `weaver mesh status` must match
the values the installing administrator recorded, out of band (the install script
does not print a fingerprint).

```bash
weaver mesh status            # identity, policy, registrations, journal
weaver mesh trust             # prints the machine key fingerprint, then pins it
```

The pin is `~/.weftos/mesh/machine.pub`, and two clients treat it differently.
The user daemon pins the machine key on its first contact with the service
(trust-on-first-use) and from then on refuses a different key. The `weaver mesh`
verbs never write a pin themselves: they compare against it when it exists and
otherwise check the key only against the record beside the socket
(`service.json`); `weaver mesh trust` is the verb that writes it. Either way, after
pinning a different key is a hard `machine_key_changed` error; replace the pin only
with `weaver mesh trust --replace` after verifying the new key out of band. The
service listens on `127.0.0.1:9489` by default; exposing it on the LAN
(`listen = "0.0.0.0:9489"` in `mesh.toml`, or `--listen` at install) is an explicit
choice, and a remote peer such as the Pi needs it.

#### Installing and removing the machine mesh service (administrator)

`weaver mesh install-service` and `weaver mesh uninstall-service` only print a
shell script. They run nothing, write nothing and refuse an `--apply` form. Read
the script, then run it as an administrator from your own account
(`sudo sh install.sh`); the service itself never runs as root.

```bash
# A machine that ran the mesh collapsed: keep its node id (--kind launchd|systemd, default: this host)
weaver mesh install-service --adopt-node-key ~/.weftos/run/node.key \
    --listen 0.0.0.0:9489 --admin-uid "$(id -u)" > install.sh
# A new machine (no ~/.weftos/run/node.key): the service generates its key
weaver mesh install-service --admin-uid "$(id -u)" > install.sh
less install.sh && sudo sh install.sh             # does NOT start the service
```

When `~/.weftos/run/node.key` exists, `install-service` refuses unless you pass
`--adopt-node-key` (keep the node id) or `--fresh-node-key` (deliberately mint a
new one; the script then carries a `# WARNING` header and peers that pinned this
machine must re-pin it). `--listen 0.0.0.0:9489` is needed for LAN peers such as
the Pi, because the service defaults to loopback while the collapsed daemon
listened on `0.0.0.0:9489`; the script header flags the exposure. Admin verbs
(`bindings`, `bind ...`, `peer ...`, `journal verify`) need root or a uid in
`admin_uids`; the script writes `admin_uids` only from `--admin-uid`, so without it
run those verbs with `sudo`.

What the script does:

- creates the service account and group (`_weftos` on macOS via `dscl`, `weftos`
  on Linux via `systemd-sysusers`), with no login shell;
- **adds the invoking user to that group.** `/var/run/weftos` (the mesh socket and
  `service.json`) is owned by the service account's group with mode 0750, so only
  group members can reach the socket. The membership applies at the next login: log
  out and in, or start a new session, before `weaver mesh status` works. Other users
  on the machine need `dseditgroup -o edit -a USER -t user _weftos` (macOS) or
  `usermod -aG weftos USER` (Linux) to use the service;
- creates `/etc/weftos`, `/var/lib/weftos/mesh` (0700, service account),
  `/var/run/weftos` (0750, service account and group), `/var/log/weftos` (macOS);
- copies the binary to `/usr/local/libexec/weftos/weaver`, root-owned 0755. The
  service never runs from a user-writable path;
- writes `/etc/weftos/mesh.toml` when absent: `listen = "127.0.0.1:9489"` unless you
  pass `--listen`, plus `--admin-uid` ids if given;
- installs the unit (`/Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.weftos.mesh.plist` and a small
  `ai.weftos.mesh-rundir` helper that recreates `/var/run/weftos` at boot, because
  macOS clears `/var/run`; or `/etc/systemd/system/weftos-mesh.service`);
- with `--adopt-node-key PATH`, copies that key to `/var/lib/weftos/mesh/node.key`
  (0600, service account) so the node id does not change. It refuses to overwrite an
  existing different key and prints the remedy (stop the service, move
  `/var/lib/weftos/mesh` aside, re-run); an identical key is a no-op, so the script
  can be re-run. The key then exists in two places until you remove the old copy;
- the script is re-runnable. An existing `mesh.toml` is kept and the script says that
  `--listen` / `--admin-uid` were not applied. `--listen` accepts `IP:PORT` or `localhost:PORT` only (no other hostnames); a
  non-loopback address or a port below 1024 is flagged in the script header and on
  stderr (the service has no capabilities and cannot bind a privileged port). Paths
  and ports come from `mesh.toml` only; the units set no environment overrides;
- macOS: the log is `/var/log/weftos/mesh.log` and is NOT rotated yet. `newsyslog`
  cannot rotate a file launchd holds open (no copytruncate; output would go to a
  deleted file), so none is installed. Follow-up: log through os_log/syslog or
  self-rotate in the daemon. The service can start before the rundir helper
  has created `/var/run/weftos`; launchd retries every 10 s until it exists.

The last line is the enable command, printed and commented, not run:
`sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.weftos.mesh.plist` or
`sudo systemctl enable --now weftos-mesh`. Stop a collapsed user daemon first
(`weaver kernel stop`); it holds port 9489. Migration from the collapsed daemon is
the owner procedure below.

#### Moving to the machine mesh service (owner migration)

Nothing here is automatic, and no migration step modifies `~/.weftos/run/node.key`,
`~/.weftos/chain/*`, `~/.clawft/*`, any project runtime directory or the Pi's
`cluster_peers.json`; they are only read (the adopt copy). The service writes only
under `/var/lib/weftos/mesh`, the user daemon only `~/.weftos/user.key` and
`~/.weftos/mesh/`. Once running in service mode the user daemon does append to its
own chain as usual, including `mesh.service.bound` and `mesh.journal.anchor` events.

1. **Record the current node id, then install the service, adopting the node key.**
   While the collapsed user daemon still runs, note its node id
   (`weaver kernel status --profile user`, the `Node:` line). Then build and install the packaged
   binary, then `weaver mesh install-service --adopt-node-key ~/.weftos/run/node.key
   --listen 0.0.0.0:9489 --admin-uid "$(id -u)" > install.sh`, read it, and run it as
   an administrator. `--listen 0.0.0.0:9489` keeps the machine reachable from the Pi
   (the service default is loopback only; step 5 cannot pass without it), and
   `--admin-uid` lets you run `weaver mesh bindings`, `bind approve` and the other
   admin verbs without `sudo`. It creates the account and
   directories, copies the binary and the key, and writes `mesh.toml`. The key is now
   in two places; the node id, and the id the Pi pinned, are unchanged. Log out and in
   so your account's new group membership applies.
2. **Give the user daemon its user key.** `weaver migrate user-key --dry-run`, then
   without `--dry-run`. `~/.weftos/user.key` gets the `chain.key` seed: same public
   key, same user id. `weaver doctor runtime` WARNs (`user_key_split`) if the two
   ever differ.
3. **Swap the listener.** Stop the collapsed user daemon (`weaver kernel stop
   --profile user`; it holds 9489), start the service (`sudo launchctl bootstrap
   system /Library/LaunchDaemons/ai.weftos.mesh.plist` or `sudo systemctl enable --now
   weftos-mesh`), then `weaver mesh status`. The install script prints no
   fingerprint, so there is nothing to compare it with; verify identity instead.
   *Adopted key (this procedure):* the `node` line of `weaver mesh status` must
   equal the node id you recorded in step 1; if it differs, stop here, the service
   is not running the key you adopted. *Fresh key (`--fresh-node-key`, or a machine
   with no `node.key`):* the id is new, so compare the `machine key` fingerprint
   and the public key from `weaver mesh status` with the values the installing
   administrator recorded, out of band (not read back through this socket). Only then run `weaver mesh trust`, which prints the
   fingerprint and pins the key in one step.
4. **Require the service.** Set `service = "required"` under `[kernel.mesh]` in
   `~/.weftos/weave.toml` and start the user daemon again. **Keep it `required` after
   step 5.** Once `~/.weftos/run/node.key` is gone, a daemon under `auto` that finds
   the service down would have to mint a new node key; it refuses to boot instead
   (because the machine key is pinned), and `required` makes it wait for the service.
   Only `off` collapses deliberately, with a new node id. It registers; the first bind
   is journalled (`how: "tofu"`, or pending until `weaver mesh bind approve <uid>`
   under the `approve` policy). `weaver kernel status --profile user` prints
   `Profile:    user (roles: user)` and `Mesh:       service (connected)`, and the
   `Node:` line keeps the node id from before.
5. **Check from the Pi** that the machine still appears under the same id. Only then
   delete `~/.weftos/run/node.key` (the doctor's `mesh.node_key_dup` WARNs until you
   do; keep a backup until peers reconnect).

Rollback, before step 5's removal: stop the service, set `service = "off"`, restart
the user daemon. It binds 9489 with its own `node.key`; no chain or id has changed.
After the removal, first copy the key back and give it to your account, or the daemon
refuses it (it must be yours and mode 0600):
`sudo cp /var/lib/weftos/mesh/node.key ~/.weftos/run/node.key && sudo chown "$(id -un)" ~/.weftos/run/node.key && chmod 600 ~/.weftos/run/node.key`. Choosing a fresh box key instead of adopting means the Pi must re-pin this
machine.

What the suite cannot check and you verify on the real install: the service
running as `_weftos`/`weftos` on 9489, the adopted node id in `weaver mesh status`,
a second real account unable to take your address (`scripts/dev/mesh-two-uid.sh`,
needs passwordless `sudo -u`), launchd/systemd restarts, the Pi seeing the same id,
and `weaver update` printing (not running) the service restart. The rest of the
Phase 3 exit list runs as your own user in `scripts/build.sh test-mesh-service`.

Removing it: `weaver mesh uninstall-service > uninstall.sh`, read it, run it as root.
It stops the unit and removes the unit files, the root-owned binary and the runtime
directory. It keeps `/var/lib/weftos/mesh` including `node.key`, the journal, logs,
`mesh.toml` and the account. `--purge-key` additionally deletes `node.key` (peers
that pinned this machine will no longer recognise it). Account removal is listed
commented out; before deleting the account run `weaver mesh bind revoke <uid>` for
every bound uid, because a later account that reuses the uid would inherit its bind.

Updating: `weaver update` replaces the user binary and restarts the user daemon. For
the service it only prints the `sudo install ... /usr/local/libexec/weftos/weaver`
and the restart line (`sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/ai.weftos.mesh` or
`sudo systemctl restart weftos-mesh`) when the packaged build differs from the one
`service.json` reports; it never calls `sudo` for the service. (For the user binary,
when copying into a root-owned install directory fails, it still falls back to
`sudo cp`.) `weaver doctor` reports the `mesh.*`
checks (reachability, proto window, pin, journal, box key mode, a leftover
`~/.weftos/run/node.key`, two listeners on 9489, force-revoked users) and the service
tier skew.

### Expected Outputs

| Output | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.weftos/` directory | Project root | Created with `runtime/` inside; the kernel adds the rest |
| `weave.toml` | Project root | Project configuration file |
| `.gitignore` update | Project root | `.weftos/` and `graphify-out/` entries appended |
| Runtime root | `.weftos/runtime/` | Socket, pid, lock, node key, chain checkpoint (`runtime_paths.rs`) |
| Kernel log | `.weftos/runtime/kernel.log` | Boot sequence with timing data |
| Agent identity files | `.clawft/` | `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.journal.md` |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] `weaver kernel status` (with the daemon started, not the ephemeral fallback) prints `State:      running`
- [ ] `weaver kernel services` lists the registered services (`cluster`, `ecc.hnsw`, ...)
- [ ] `.weftos/runtime/` exists and holds `kernel.sock` and `kernel.pid` while the daemon runs
- [ ] `weave.toml` exists and is valid TOML
- [ ] `.gitignore` contains the `.weftos/` entry
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in `weave.toml`

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `weave.toml` is not schema-validated | Unknown keys are ignored: a typo, or `[domain]` / `[embedding]` as `weaver init` writes them, does nothing | Strict top-level check exists in the library (`Config::from_json_str_strict`, `DenyUnknown::Yes`, `config/mod.rs:169`); no caller outside `config/mod.rs` (`grep -rn from_json_str_strict crates`) |
| `[embedding]`, `[sources.*]`, `[tick]` and `[domain]` written by `weaver init` are not fields of the daemon's `Config` | Editing them does not change how the daemon boots (`weft assess` reads its own `[project]` and `[assessment]` sections of `.weftos/weave.toml`) | Not tracked; the generator and the schema disagree |

## SOP 2: Building the Knowledge Graph

### Purpose and Scope

Populate the ECC (ExoChain + CausalGraph + CrossRef + HNSW) knowledge graph
with comprehensive information about the project's codebase, infrastructure,
dependencies, and operational behavior. This SOP covers initial graph population
and the ongoing DEMOCRITUS refinement loop.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| SOP 1 completed | Kernel booted and healthy |
| ONNX embeddings enabled | `embedding.provider = "onnx"` in weave.toml |
| Source files accessible | File patterns in `sources.files.patterns` are correct |
| Git history available | `.git/` directory with commit history |

### Procedure

#### Phase 1: Static Code Analysis (Tree-sitter)

The `clawft-plugin-treesitter` crate provides AST parsing, symbol extraction,
and complexity metrics. Spawn a code analysis agent:

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name code-analyzer \
  --tool treesitter_parse \
  --tool treesitter_symbols \
  --tool treesitter_complexity
```

The agent uses three operations from `analysis.rs`:

1. **`parse_source()`** -- Parses each source file into a tree-sitter AST.
   Supported languages are auto-detected from file extensions.

2. **`extract_symbols()`** -- Extracts named symbols (functions, structs,
   classes, methods, interfaces) with line ranges and visibility.

3. **`compute_complexity()`** -- Calculates cyclomatic complexity, nesting
   depth, and function-level metrics.

For each symbol discovered, the agent emits an impulse to the ECC:

```
ImpulseType::BeliefUpdate
  source_structure: ResourceTree (0x02)
  target_structure: HnswIndex (0x04)
  payload: { symbol_name, file_path, kind, line_range, complexity }
```

**What this produces in the graph:**

- ResourceTree nodes for every file, module, function, type, and trait
- HNSW vectors for every symbol (embedded via the symbol name + docstring +
  context window)
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Enables` between dependency
  relationships (function A calls function B)

**Current tool status:** Tree-sitter plugin exists with parse, symbols, and
complexity analysis implemented. Languages supported: Rust, TypeScript,
JavaScript, Python, Go, C, C++.

#### Phase 2: Git History Mining

The `clawft-plugin-git` crate wraps `git2` and provides tools for repository
analysis:

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name git-miner \
  --tool git_log \
  --tool git_diff \
  --tool git_blame \
  --tool git_status
```

The agent performs:

1. **Commit graph traversal** -- Walk all commits, extract messages, authors,
   timestamps, and changed file sets.

2. **Change frequency analysis** -- Identify hot files (frequently changed) and
   change coupling (files that change together).

3. **Blame-based ownership** -- Determine per-file and per-function ownership
   from `git blame`.

4. **Branch topology** -- Map branch structure, merge patterns, and release
   tags.

**What this produces in the graph:**

- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Follows` for temporal commit
  ordering
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Correlates` for files that
  co-change (statistical coupling)
- ExoChain events for each significant commit (tagged, merged, or affecting
  many files)
- CrossRef entries linking commits to the files/symbols they touch

**Current tool status:** Git plugin fully implemented with clone, commit,
branch, diff, blame, log, and status operations via `git2`.

#### Phase 3: Dependency Analysis

For each project type, a specialized scan extracts the dependency graph:

| Project Type | Source | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock` | `clawft-plugin-cargo` (crate metadata, dep tree) |
| Node.js | `package.json` + `package-lock.json` | Custom agent (parse JSON, resolve versions) |
| Python | `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` | Custom agent (parse TOML/text) |
| Docker | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` | `clawft-plugin-containers` |
| Infrastructure | Terraform, Vercel config | Custom agent (parse HCL/JSON) |

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name dep-analyzer \
  --tool cargo_metadata \
  --tool file_read
```

**What this produces in the graph:**

- ResourceTree nodes for each dependency (name, version, features)
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Enables` between dependency and
  dependent
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Inhibits` for version conflicts
  or known CVEs

**Current tool status:** The Cargo plugin exists. Node.js and Python dependency
parsing requires custom agent prompts using `file_read` tool -- no dedicated
plugin yet.

#### Phase 4: Infrastructure and Deployment Scanning

Gather deployment topology from configuration files:

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name infra-scanner \
  --tool file_read \
  --tool file_search
```

The agent scans for and parses:

- `vercel.json` / `.vercel/` -- Deployment configuration, environment bindings
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` -- Container definitions, port mappings
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` -- CI/CD pipeline definitions, test/deploy stages
- `.env.example` / `.env.production` -- Environment variable inventory (names
  only, never values)
- DNS/domain configuration -- Extracted from Vercel project settings or
  infrastructure-as-code

**What this produces in the graph:**

- ResourceTree nodes for each deployment target, environment, and service
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Causes` linking deploy configs to
  the services they produce
- CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Enables` linking environment
  variables to the features they gate

**Current tool status:** Containers plugin exists. Vercel/GitHub Actions
parsing requires custom agents. This is a priority gap for Sprint 14.

#### Phase 5: DEMOCRITUS Loop Activation

Once the initial scan phases complete, the DEMOCRITUS cognitive loop takes over
for continuous refinement. The loop runs on every kernel tick (default 50ms):

```
SENSE -> EMBED -> SEARCH -> UPDATE -> COMMIT
```

1. **SENSE** -- Drains the `ImpulseQueue` for up to `max_impulses_per_tick`
   (default 64) new events from the scan agents.

2. **EMBED** -- Produces vector embeddings for each impulse payload using
   the configured `EmbeddingProvider` (ONNX all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

3. **SEARCH** -- Queries HNSW for `search_k` (default 5) nearest neighbors
   to each new embedding. This finds semantically similar existing nodes.

4. **UPDATE** -- For each pair that exceeds `correlation_threshold` (default
   0.7 cosine similarity), creates a `CausalEdgeType::Correlates` edge in
   the CausalGraph and registers a `CrossRef` in the CrossRefStore.

5. **COMMIT** -- Logs the tick result to ExoChain for auditability.

The loop operates within a `tick_budget_us` (default 15ms) and will stop early
if the budget is exceeded, ensuring the kernel remains responsive.

**Tick result metrics:**

```rust
DemocritusTickResult {
    impulses_sensed: usize,
    embeddings_produced: usize,
    searches_performed: usize,
    edges_added: usize,
    crossrefs_added: usize,
    budget_exceeded: bool,
    duration_us: u64,
}
```

#### Phase 6: Cross-Reference Consolidation

After initial population, run a consolidation pass:

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name crossref-builder \
  --tool graph_query \
  --tool graph_update
```

This agent walks the CausalGraph and CrossRefStore to:

1. Resolve transitive dependencies (A enables B, B enables C => A transitively
   enables C)
2. Identify contradiction clusters (conflicting edges that need review)
3. Mark high-centrality nodes (files/symbols that many things depend on)
4. Calculate graph coherence metrics

Each cross-reference uses `UniversalNodeId` (BLAKE3 hash of structure_tag +
context_id + hlc_timestamp + content_hash + parent_id) to uniquely identify
nodes across all four ECC structures (ExoChain, ResourceTree, CausalGraph,
HnswIndex).

### Expected Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| Populated ResourceTree | Hierarchical model of files, modules, symbols, dependencies, infra |
| CausalGraph | DAG with typed/weighted edges (Causes, Enables, Correlates, etc.) |
| HNSW index | Vector embeddings for semantic search across all entities |
| CrossRefStore | Bidirectional index linking nodes across all ECC structures |
| ExoChain audit trail | Tamper-evident log of every graph mutation |
| Graph statistics | Node count, edge count, coherence score, coverage percentage |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] ResourceTree node count > 0 for each scanned source directory
- [ ] CausalGraph contains at least `Enables` edges for dependency relationships
- [ ] HNSW index has entries for all extracted symbols
- [ ] CrossRef count > 0 (structures are actually linked)
- [ ] DEMOCRITUS tick results show `edges_added > 0` in at least one cycle
- [ ] ExoChain has genesis + at least one scan event
- [ ] No ExoChain hash verification failures

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No dedicated Node.js dependency plugin | Must use generic file_read + custom prompts | `clawft-plugin-npm` (Sprint 15) |
| No Vercel/GitHub Actions parser | Infra scanning is shallow | `clawft-plugin-ci` (Sprint 15) |
| Tree-sitter grammars bundled at compile time | Cannot add languages without rebuild | Dynamic grammar loading (Sprint 16) |
| ONNX model is 86 MB | Large for CI or ephemeral environments | Quantized model option (Sprint 15) |
| No incremental re-scan | Full rescan on every boot | File-watcher-based delta scan (Sprint 14) |
| DEMOCRITUS correlation_threshold is global | Same threshold for all entity types | Per-entity-type thresholds (Sprint 15) |

## SOP 3: Cross-Project Coordination

### Purpose and Scope

Enable two or more WeftOS instances running on different projects to share
knowledge, coordinate changes, and maintain a federated view of the full system.
This SOP covers the mesh networking setup, trust model, and coordination
patterns.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| SOP 1 + SOP 2 completed | On each participating project |
| Network connectivity | Projects must be able to reach each other (same host, LAN, or WAN) |
| Shared org identity | Projects belong to the same governance domain |
| Mesh feature enabled | `weaver` built with the `mesh` feature; it is in the default feature set (`crates/clawft-weave/Cargo.toml`, `default = [..., "mesh", ...]`) |

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Designate Project Roles

SOP 3 configures the mesh as **separate daemons that each listen**: each project
runs its own `weaver kernel start` (collapsed mode), with its own runtime root
and its own `[kernel.mesh]` block. That is the single-tenant / standalone shape in
ADR-103 D2. Two limits apply:

- A project kernel that a user daemon supervises (`weaver kernel start --project
  <id|name>`) never listens: the `project` profile turns the mesh listener off and
  ignores a project `weave.toml` mesh section with a warning
  (`crates/clawft-weave/src/project_profile.rs:6-8`). Such projects reach the mesh
  through the machine mesh service (see "Optional: machine mesh service" in SOP 1).
- Port 9489 is the machine's weave port (ADR-103 D1). Two daemons on one host
  cannot both bind it; give every additional daemon on the host its own port.

For the initial WeaveLogic deployment:

| Project | Role | Mesh Address |
|---|---|---|
| clawft (weftos.weavelogic.ai docs) | **Coordinator** | `127.0.0.1:9489` (same host) |
| weavelogic.ai | **Member** | `127.0.0.1:9471` |

Role names are a convention of this SOP: the kernel has no coordinator/member
distinction in `MeshConfig`; the member simply lists the coordinator in
`seed_peers`. Use `0.0.0.0:<port>` only for a listener that remote hosts must
reach (see "What is enforced today" below).

#### Step 2: Configure Mesh Networking

The schema is `[kernel.mesh]` (`MeshConfig`,
`crates/clawft-types/src/config/kernel.rs:896-973`): `enabled` (default `false`),
`transport` (`tcp` default, `ws`, `quic`), `listen_addr` (alias `listen`, default
`0.0.0.0:9489`), `discovery` (default `false`), `seed_peers`, `noise` (default
`false`), `noise_key_path`, `admission` (`off | observe | enforce`, default
`observe`), `genesis_hash`, `admission_open_membership`, `service`
(`auto | required | off`) and `service_socket`. There is no `[mesh]` table, no
`bind_address`, no `node_id` key (the node id is derived from the node key,
ADR-103 D11) and no TLS block. Encryption is Noise XX (`noise = true`), not
certificates.

Run `weaver init --mesh` to have the block generated, or add it by hand. This
pair starts on this tree. It was checked on 2026-10-02 with two `weaver kernel
start --foreground` processes, each with its own `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`, using
ports 19489 and 19471 so as not to collide with a machine's real 9489.

**On the coordinator (clawft):**

```toml
# weave.toml
[kernel.mesh]
enabled = true
transport = "tcp"
listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:9489"
noise = true
```

**On the member (weavelogic.ai):**

```toml
# weave.toml
[kernel.mesh]
enabled = true
transport = "tcp"
listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:9471"
noise = true
seed_peers = ["127.0.0.1:9489"]   # Or the coordinator's reachable address
```

Start each with `weaver kernel start` from its project directory, then check
`weaver kernel status` (the `Mesh:` line reads `collapsed` and the kernel log
says `Mesh transport started (tcp on 127.0.0.1:9471, 1 seed peers)`) and
`weaver kernel services` (a `mesh` service). `weaver cluster nodes` on the
member listed the seed address `127.0.0.1:9489` as a node; on the coordinator
the member did not appear within 30 s of the check, so treat "both sides list
each other" as not yet demonstrated by this SOP.

#### Step 3: Establish the Trust Model

**What is enforced today.** The mesh transport (`crates/clawft-kernel/src/mesh.rs`)
can encrypt with Noise XX (`noise = true`). Admission is the K1 `CryptoGate`
(`crates/clawft-kernel/src/mesh_admit.rs`, `mesh_admit_gate.rs`), set by
`kernel.mesh.admission`:

| `admission` | Behaviour (`MeshConfig.admission`, `kernel.rs:933-949`; `CryptoGate::admit`, `mesh_admit_gate.rs:311-352`) |
|---|---|
| `off` | No policy. A peer that sends a signed `AdmitHello` still has it verified and its `source_node` bound to the verified key. |
| `observe` (default) | Checks the hello, genesis, revocation and verdict, records would-be refusals, never refuses and never marks a peer admitted. Takes effect only once `genesis_hash` is pinned. **Not protection**: route ownership and `src_scope` are enforced only under `enforce` (ADR-103 A10). |
| `enforce` | Refuses unsigned, plaintext, wrong-genesis (`wrong_genesis`), revoked and verdict-denied peers. Needs `genesis_hash` and a governance gate, or `admission_open_membership = true`, which admits every peer that presents a valid hello for the right genesis (`boot.rs:739-766`). |

- **Genesis hash.** Set `kernel.mesh.genesis_hash` (64 hex characters) to the same
  value on both sides; a peer whose hello carries a different one is refused with
  `wrong_genesis` under `enforce` and recorded under `observe`. It is a cluster
  label, not a credential: anyone who knows it can present it (`mesh_admit_gate.rs:172`).
- **Revocation.** `weaver mesh peer revoke <node-id>` (machine mesh service only)
  closes the peer's live connection in every mode; under `enforce` the peer is
  also refused on reconnect (ADR-103 A10).
- **Peer discovery.** Static `seed_peers`, and `discovery = true` for DHT
  discovery (`MeshConfig.discovery`). Discovery backends beyond `seed_peers`
  are not exercised by this SOP.
- **Capabilities.** `AgentCapabilities` and `CapabilityChecker`
  (`crates/clawft-kernel/src/capability.rs`) gate what operations an agent may
  perform; this SOP has not verified how they apply to remote peers.

**Planned, not enforced.** There is no pairing handshake in the mesh runtime:
`ClusterMembership::open_pairing_window` (`crates/clawft-kernel/src/cluster.rs:1173`)
is called only from unit tests (`cluster.rs:2030-2092`), and no CLI command opens
a window. `weaver cluster join` / `leave` are the manual membership verbs. Per-peer
certificates and a CA do not exist: there is nothing to configure beyond Noise,
the genesis pin and admission mode. Under the default (`observe`) a peer that
can reach the listener can join; set `admission = "enforce"` with a
`genesis_hash` for a listener that crosses a trust boundary. The decision to
enforce by default is ADR-103 A6 (observe for one release, then enforce after
the Pi and ESP32 are redeployed).

**For same-host deployments** (like WeaveLogic's server): use `127.0.0.1`
listeners with distinct ports, as in Step 2. Noise is optional on loopback.

**For cross-host deployments** (client engagements): bind a reachable address
(`0.0.0.0:<port>` or the interface address), set `noise = true`,
`admission = "enforce"` and the same `genesis_hash` on every node, and list the
other nodes in `seed_peers`. Note the default `listen_addr` is `0.0.0.0:9489`
for the collapsed daemon, so enabling the mesh without setting
`listen_addr` exposes the port on every interface (ADR-103 D1, below).

#### Step 4: Configure the Federated Knowledge Graph

> Steps 4 and 5 describe the intended federation design. They were not
> re-checked against the code when Steps 1-3 were brought up to date; treat the
> protocol details (gossip interval, query forwarding, event bridging) as design
> intent until verified.

The ECC graph spans projects through a federated model, not a single shared
database. Each project maintains its own:

- ExoChain (local append-only ledger)
- ResourceTree (local resource hierarchy)
- CausalGraph (local causal DAG)
- HNSW index (local vector store)

Cross-project links are established through `CrossRef` entries with
`StructureTag::Custom(0x10)` designating "remote project" references:

```
UniversalNodeId (local) <--CrossRef--> UniversalNodeId (remote)
```

The mesh layer synchronizes these cross-references using three protocols:

1. **Gossip** -- Lightweight metadata exchange (node counts, edge counts,
   last-updated timestamps) on a 30-second interval.

2. **Query forwarding** -- When a local HNSW search returns results above
   threshold, the query is optionally forwarded to connected peers for
   broader search. Results are merged and ranked.

3. **Event bridging** -- Significant ExoChain events (deploys, test failures,
   dependency updates) are broadcast to connected peers as impulses.

#### Step 5: Define Coordination Patterns

For the WeaveLogic deployment, three coordination patterns are relevant:

**Pattern A: Shared Dependency Tracking**

Both projects use Next.js. When weavelogic.ai updates its Next.js version,
the coordinator detects the dependency change and:

1. Emits an impulse to the clawft docs project
2. The docs project's DEMOCRITUS loop receives the impulse
3. A CausalGraph edge `CausalEdgeType::Correlates` is created linking the
   two dependency nodes
4. If the version differs, a `CausalEdgeType::Contradicts` edge flags the
   mismatch for review

**Pattern B: Brand and Design Consistency**

Both projects share brand assets (colors, logos, typography). The cross-ref
system tracks:

- Shared CSS variables / Tailwind config values
- Common component patterns (headers, footers, CTAs)
- Design token files

When a brand asset changes in one project, the mesh broadcasts the change and
the receiving project's knowledge graph flags all dependent components.

**Pattern C: Deploy Ordering**

When both projects deploy to Vercel, the coordination layer can enforce ordering
rules:

- Docs site deploys should follow (not precede) source code changes
- If clawft publishes a new API doc, the docs deploy should include it
- If weavelogic.ai CTA links to docs, both deploys should be coordinated

This is tracked via CausalGraph edges with `CausalEdgeType::Follows` between
deploy events in each project's ExoChain.

### Expected Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| Mesh connection established | Two kernels connected and exchanging gossip |
| Cross-project CrossRefs | References linking entities across project boundaries |
| Dependency correlation edges | CausalGraph edges for shared dependencies |
| Event bridge active | ExoChain events flowing between projects |
| Federated search working | HNSW queries returning results from both projects |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] `weaver kernel services` on each daemon shows the `mesh` service as healthy, and `weaver kernel status` shows `Mesh:       collapsed` (or `service (connected)` under the machine mesh service)
- [ ] `weaver cluster nodes` on the member lists the coordinator (seed peers appear by address first)
- [ ] At least one cross-project CrossRef exists after initial sync
- [ ] Gossip interval producing regular metadata exchange
- [ ] No `wrong_genesis` refusals in the kernel log

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Mesh networking is transport-layer only (K6.1) | No application-level protocol for graph sync | Graph sync protocol (Sprint 16) |
| No conflict resolution for competing edges | Concurrent edits to same cross-ref can diverge | CRDT-based edge merging (Sprint 17) |
| Gossip is push-only | New peers must wait for next gossip round | Pull-on-connect (Sprint 15) |
| No multi-tenant isolation within mesh | All connected projects see all events | Namespace isolation (Sprint 14, deferred) |
| Discovery backends (mDNS, Kademlia) are feature-gated | Must compile with `mesh-discovery` | Enable by default in v0.4 |
| No cross-project agent migration | Agents cannot move between projects | Agent serialization + transfer (Sprint 17) |

## SOP 4: Continuous Assessment

### Purpose and Scope

Maintain the knowledge graph as a living, continuously updated representation
of the system. This SOP covers the triggers, monitors, and reporting mechanisms
that keep the graph current and surface findings to stakeholders.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| SOP 1 + SOP 2 completed | Knowledge graph populated |
| File watcher available | `notify` crate (workspace dependency, already included) |
| Git hooks writable | Ability to install post-commit hooks |
| CI/CD access | Ability to add pipeline steps (for CI-triggered assessment) |

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Configure Assessment Triggers

Four trigger types drive re-assessment:

**Trigger A: File System Watch (Real-time)**

The `notify` crate (v7, already a workspace dependency) watches the project
directory for file changes:

```toml
# weave.toml
[assessment.triggers.filesystem]
enabled = true
debounce_ms = 2000         # Wait 2s after last change before scanning
patterns = ["**/*.ts", "**/*.rs", "**/*.json"]
exclude = ["node_modules/**", "target/**", ".weftos/**"]
```

When a file change is detected:
1. The modified file is re-parsed by tree-sitter
2. Changed symbols are re-embedded and re-indexed in HNSW
3. ResourceTree nodes are updated
4. DEMOCRITUS processes the resulting impulses on the next tick

**Trigger B: Git Hook (On Commit)**

Install a post-commit hook:

```bash
weft hooks install --type post-commit
```

This creates `.git/hooks/post-commit` that calls `weft assess --scope commit`,
which:
1. Reads the commit diff to identify changed files
2. Runs targeted tree-sitter analysis on changed files only
3. Updates git-derived CausalGraph edges (co-change correlations)
4. Logs the assessment to ExoChain

**Trigger C: CI Pipeline (On Push/PR)**

Add a step to the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: WeftOS Assessment
  run: |
    weft assess --scope ci --format github-annotations
```

This produces GitHub-compatible annotations for:
- Complexity regressions (function complexity increased)
- Dependency changes (new, removed, or upgraded dependencies)
- Coupling anomalies (unexpected file co-changes)
- Coverage of the knowledge graph (percentage of code indexed)

**Trigger D: Scheduled (Cron)**

The kernel's built-in cron subsystem (implemented in `cron.rs`) runs periodic
full assessments:

```toml
# weave.toml
[assessment.triggers.scheduled]
enabled = true
cron = "0 2 * * *"         # Daily at 2 AM
scope = "full"              # Full rescan, not incremental
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Assessment Pipeline

Each assessment run follows this pipeline:

```
TRIGGER -> SCOPE -> SCAN -> ANALYZE -> REPORT -> COMMIT
```

1. **SCOPE** -- Determine what to scan based on the trigger type:
   - `commit` -- Only files changed in the last commit
   - `ci` -- All files changed in the PR/push
   - `full` -- Everything in `sources.files.patterns`
   - `dependency` -- Only dependency manifests (Cargo.toml, package.json)

2. **SCAN** -- Run the appropriate Phase 1-4 agents from SOP 2 on the
   scoped file set.

3. **ANALYZE** -- Compare new scan results against the existing graph:
   - New nodes = additions to the codebase
   - Missing nodes = deletions
   - Changed embeddings = modified semantics
   - New edges = new relationships discovered
   - Broken edges = dependencies that no longer hold

4. **REPORT** -- Generate findings in the configured format.

5. **COMMIT** -- Log the assessment result to ExoChain.

#### Step 3: Configure Reporting

Reports can be surfaced through multiple channels:

**Terminal Output (default):**

```bash
weft assess --scope full --format table
```

Produces a summary table with:
- Total nodes / edges / cross-refs
- Nodes added / removed / modified since last assessment
- Top 5 highest-centrality nodes (most depended-upon)
- Top 5 highest-churn files (most frequently changed)
- Coherence score (ratio of edges with evidence vs. total edges)

**JSON Export:**

```bash
weft assess --scope full --format json > .weftos/artifacts/assessment-latest.json
```

Produces a machine-readable report suitable for dashboard ingestion or
comparison between assessments.

**GitHub PR Comments (future):**

```bash
weft assess --scope ci --format github-pr --pr-number 42
```

Posts a comment on the PR with assessment findings. This requires the
`gh` CLI and appropriate permissions. Not yet implemented.

**Dashboard (future):**

The GUI block engine (Sprint 13) provides a `BudgetBlock` for per-agent cost
tracking. Additional assessment blocks are planned for Sprint 15:
- Graph health block (node/edge counts over time)
- Churn heatmap block (file change frequency visualization)
- Dependency graph block (interactive dependency visualization)

#### Step 4: Connect to the WeaveLogic Consulting Product

This SOP is the operational backbone of WeaveLogic's consulting offering. The
connection points are:

1. **Initial Assessment Report** -- Run SOP 1 + SOP 2 on a client's codebase.
   The resulting knowledge graph and assessment report form the basis of the
   initial consulting engagement.

2. **Ongoing Monitoring** -- Set up continuous assessment (this SOP) to
   provide ongoing value. Monthly reports showing graph evolution, complexity
   trends, and coupling patterns.

3. **AI Assessor Integration** (Sprint 14 backlog) -- An LLM-powered agent
   that interprets the knowledge graph and produces natural-language
   recommendations. This agent reads the CausalGraph, identifies risk
   patterns, and generates actionable findings.

4. **Comparison Reports** -- Compare a client's graph metrics against
   baselines (industry averages or the client's own historical data) to
   show improvement over time.

### Expected Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| File watcher active | Real-time re-indexing of changed files |
| Git hook installed | Post-commit assessment trigger |
| CI step configured | PR/push assessment with annotations |
| Cron assessment | Nightly full rescan |
| Assessment reports | JSON + table output for each assessment run |
| ExoChain audit trail | Every assessment logged with results |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] File watcher detects and re-indexes a test file change within 5 seconds
- [ ] Post-commit hook runs without error on a test commit
- [ ] Assessment report contains non-zero node and edge counts
- [ ] Coherence score is reported and > 0
- [ ] ExoChain contains assessment events with valid hash chain
- [ ] CI assessment completes within 60 seconds for incremental scope

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No incremental tree-sitter re-parse | Full file re-parse on every change | Incremental parsing with tree-sitter edit API (Sprint 15) |
| No GitHub PR comment integration | Findings only in CI logs | `weft assess --format github-pr` (Sprint 15) |
| No baseline comparison | Cannot show improvement over time | Historical assessment storage + diff (Sprint 16) |
| AI Assessor not implemented | No natural-language recommendations | AI Assessor agent type (Sprint 14) |
| No alerting/notification | Must check reports manually | Webhook + email alerts on threshold breach (Sprint 16) |

## SOP 5: Iterative SOP Improvement

### Purpose and Scope

Use the WeftOS knowledge graph and operational telemetry to continuously improve
these SOPs themselves. This SOP defines the feedback loop between execution
data and procedure refinement.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| SOPs 1-4 executed at least once | Baseline data from at least one full deployment |
| ExoChain with assessment history | Multiple assessment events for trend analysis |
| Session history | At least 5 sessions in `.weftos/sessions/history/` |

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Define SOP Effectiveness Metrics

Each SOP tracks metrics that indicate whether it is working correctly:

**SOP 1 (Adding WeftOS) Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Time to first kernel boot | < 10 minutes | ExoChain genesis timestamp - init timestamp |
| Config errors on first boot | 0 | Kernel boot log error count |
| Manual config edits needed | < 5 | Session history (count of weave.toml edits) |

**SOP 2 (Knowledge Graph) Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Code coverage (% files indexed) | > 90% | ResourceTree node count / total file count |
| Symbol coverage | > 80% | Extracted symbols / estimated total symbols |
| Graph density | > 0.01 | Edge count / (node count * (node count - 1)) |
| DEMOCRITUS tick efficiency | < 15ms avg | DemocritusTickResult.duration_us |
| Correlation discovery rate | > 0 per day | DemocritusTickResult.edges_added cumulative |

**SOP 3 (Cross-Project) Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Mesh uptime | > 99% | Gossip interval regularity |
| Cross-ref count | > 10 | CrossRefStore with remote StructureTag |
| Event bridge latency | < 1s | Timestamp diff between emit and receive |
| Federated search recall | > 70% | Manual spot-check of cross-project queries |

**SOP 4 (Continuous Assessment) Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Assessment latency (incremental) | < 30s | ExoChain event timestamps |
| Assessment latency (full) | < 5m | ExoChain event timestamps |
| False positive rate | < 10% | Manual review of flagged findings |
| Graph staleness | < 24h | Max time since last ResourceTree update |

#### Step 2: Collect Execution Telemetry

Every SOP execution is instrumented through the ExoChain. Each significant
step produces a chain event with:

- `kind`: The SOP step identifier (e.g., "sop1.kernel_boot", "sop2.treesitter_scan")
- `source`: The agent or operator that executed the step
- `payload`: Timing data, error counts, output statistics
- `prev_hash`: Link to the previous event (tamper-evident chain)
- `payload_hash`: Content commitment for the payload

This data is queryable through:

```bash
weft chain query --kind "sop*" --since "7d" --format json
```

#### Step 3: Analyze SOP Performance

Run a periodic (monthly) SOP review by spawning an analysis agent:

```bash
weft agent spawn --type researcher --name sop-analyst \
  --tool chain_query \
  --tool graph_query
```

The agent:

1. Queries ExoChain for all SOP-related events in the review period
2. Calculates the metrics from Step 1 against their targets
3. Identifies steps that consistently exceed time targets
4. Identifies steps that produce errors or require manual intervention
5. Generates a SOP Performance Report

#### Step 4: Apply Improvements

Based on the analysis, improvements fall into three categories:

**Category A: Procedure Updates**

If a step consistently fails or requires manual intervention, update the SOP
procedure text. Track the change in the ExoChain:

```bash
weft chain append --kind "sop.update" --source "operator" \
  --payload '{"sop": 2, "step": "phase1", "change": "added exclude pattern for generated files"}'
```

**Category B: Tooling Improvements**

If a step is slow or error-prone due to missing tooling, create a backlog item:

```bash
weft task create --title "Build npm dependency parser plugin" \
  --priority high \
  --labels "sop-improvement,tooling" \
  --body "SOP 2 Phase 3 requires manual parsing of package.json. Build clawft-plugin-npm."
```

**Category C: Threshold Tuning**

If metrics consistently miss targets, evaluate whether the target is wrong
(adjust the SOP) or the system needs improvement (file a bug):

- `correlation_threshold` too high? Lower it and measure false positive impact.
- `tick_budget_us` too low? Increase it and measure kernel responsiveness impact.
- `max_impulses_per_tick` bottleneck? Increase and watch memory usage.

#### Step 5: Version the SOPs

SOPs are versioned documents. Each update increments the version:

- **Patch** (1.0.x): Typo fixes, clarification, no behavioral change
- **Minor** (1.x.0): New steps, changed thresholds, improved quality gates
- **Major** (x.0.0): Structural reorganization, new prerequisites, breaking
  changes to expected outputs

The version history is tracked in the ExoChain and in this document's header.

### Expected Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| SOP Performance Report | Monthly metrics vs. targets for each SOP |
| Improvement backlog items | Tasks for tooling and procedure improvements |
| Updated SOP document | New version with applied improvements |
| ExoChain update events | Audit trail of all SOP changes |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All SOP metrics have defined targets and data sources
- [ ] Monthly review completed within 1 business day
- [ ] Every SOP change logged in ExoChain
- [ ] No metric below target for 3 consecutive months without action
- [ ] SOP version incremented on every substantive change

### Known Limitations and Future Improvements

| Limitation | Impact | Future Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Manual metric collection | Monthly review is labor-intensive | Automated metric dashboard (Sprint 16) |
| No A/B testing of SOP changes | Cannot empirically compare procedure variants | SOP variant tracking in ExoChain (Sprint 17) |
| Session history is JSONL, not indexed | Slow to query across many sessions | Session indexing with HNSW (exists in session_indexer.rs) |
| No cross-client SOP benchmarking | Cannot compare deployment efficiency across engagements | Anonymized metric aggregation (v1.0) |

### Project 2: weavelogic.ai

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Path | `/claw/root/weavelogic/projects/weavelogic.ai/` |
| Type | Next.js monorepo (frontend + API) with Prisma ORM |
| Current .weftos/ | Does not exist |
| Status | SOP 1 not started |

**SOP 1 steps:**
1. Run `weaver init` from project root
2. `weave.toml` will detect Node.js (package.json present)
3. Configure patterns: `["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.prisma"]`
4. Exclude: `["node_modules/**", ".next/**", ".weftos/**"]`
5. Copy ONNX model from clawft (avoid re-downloading)
6. Boot kernel

**SOP 2 priority data sources:**
1. Package.json workspace structure (services/frontend, services/api, packages/*)
2. Prisma schema (database model -- extremely high value for knowledge graph)
3. Next.js page/route structure (app/ directory)
4. API endpoint definitions
5. Git history

### Cross-Project Coordination (SOP 3)

**Shared dependencies to track:**
- Next.js version (both projects)
- TypeScript version
- Tailwind CSS (if used in both)
- Vercel deployment platform

**Coordination patterns to implement:**
1. Dependency version sync alerts
2. Brand asset change propagation
3. Deploy ordering (clawft source changes -> docs deploy -> weavelogic.ai CTA verification)

**Mesh configuration:**
Both projects on the same host, use localhost addresses, development TLS mode.

## Appendix C: Security Considerations

### Data Classification

| Data | Classification | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Source code (indexed) | Confidential | Stored only in .weftos/ (gitignored), never transmitted unencrypted |
| Embeddings | Internal | HNSW vectors are not reversible to source but contain semantic signal |
| ExoChain events | Internal | Append-only, signed with Ed25519 + optional ML-DSA-65 |
| Environment variable names | Confidential | Names indexed, values NEVER stored or transmitted |
| Environment variable values | Secret | NEVER indexed, NEVER stored in knowledge graph |
| Git commit messages | Internal | Indexed for semantic search |
| API keys/credentials | Secret | NEVER processed by any WeftOS agent or tool |
| Cross-project gossip | Internal | Encrypted via Noise protocol in mesh transport |

### Access Control

- Agents operate under the `AgentCapabilities` system
- Each agent has a defined capability set (filesystem read, filesystem write,
  network, etc.)
- The `CapabilityChecker` validates every tool invocation against the agent's
  capabilities
- Cross-project mesh connections require governance genesis hash match
- The governance gate (`GateBackend`) can block operations that exceed the
  configured `risk_threshold`

### Audit Trail

Every significant operation is logged to the ExoChain with:
- SHAKE-256 hash linking (tamper-evident chain)
- Ed25519 signatures (authenticity)
- Optional ML-DSA-65 dual signatures (post-quantum readiness)
- RVF (RuVector Format) segment encoding with witness chains
