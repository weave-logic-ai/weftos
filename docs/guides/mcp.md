# `weft mcp add` — installing third-party MCP servers

This page covers the WeftOS-side install path for adding a third-party
MCP server (Claude Code, claude-flow, IDE bridges, etc.) into your
project's `weave.toml`. For the broader integration model — how
sessions are created, how skills scope tool visibility, how
`internal_only` hides tools from the LLM by default — see
[`mcp-integration.md`](./mcp-integration.md).

> Most agents reference `claude mcp add ...` (the Claude Desktop /
> Claude Code path). The WeftOS daemon reads its server list from
> `.weftos/weave.toml` instead, so the steps below are the daemon
> equivalent. Both tools can coexist; they read independent config.

## TL;DR

```bash
# Install claude-flow as an MCP server in this project's weave.toml
weft mcp add claude-flow \
  --command "npx" \
  --args "-y,@claude-flow/cli@latest" \
  --internal-only
```

Then start the daemon (or `weft kernel restart` if it's already up).
Run `weft mcp list` to confirm the session attached.

## Why we don't ship claude-flow first-party

claude-flow stays user-installed, not vendored into the WeftOS
release. See [ADR-054](../adr/adr-054-claude-flow-integration.md) for
the full rationale. The short version: vendoring adds Node / npm to
the WeftOS release matrix, and the protocol-level integration via
MCP already gives us everything we need without that cost.

## What `weft mcp add` writes

`weft mcp add` edits your project's `.weftos/weave.toml` and adds a
`[tools.mcp_servers.<name>]` table with the connection parameters.
After running the example above you will see:

```toml
[tools.mcp_servers.claude-flow]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@claude-flow/cli@latest"]
internalOnly = true

[tools.mcp_servers.claude-flow.env]
# (no env vars set; add API keys here)
```

The same shape works for HTTP MCP servers — set `url = "..."` and
omit `command`/`args`. The serde alias `internalOnly` matches the
field name used by Claude Desktop's `claude mcp add`, so you can
copy-paste between them.

## Sample `weave.toml` excerpt with multiple servers

```toml
# .weftos/weave.toml

[tools.mcp_servers.claude-code]
# Claude Code as an MCP client (stdio).
command = "claude"
args    = ["mcp-serve"]
internalOnly = true

[tools.mcp_servers.claude-flow]
# claude-flow user-install. See CLAUDE.md and ADR-054.
command = "npx"
args    = ["-y", "@claude-flow/cli@latest"]
internalOnly = true

[tools.mcp_servers.claude-flow.env]
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "${env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
CLAUDE_FLOW_HOOKS = "1"

[tools.mcp_servers.plane]
# Third-party HTTP MCP server.
url = "https://mcp.plane.so/v1"
internalOnly = true

[tools.mcp_servers.plane.env]
PLANE_API_KEY = "${env:PLANE_API_KEY}"
```

`${env:VAR}` references are resolved at daemon startup. Missing
variables surface as a startup error rather than a silent empty
string, so a typo in your shell environment fails loudly.

## Setting environment variables for an MCP server

Two ways to provide API keys / tokens:

1. **Pass-through from the shell** (recommended). Reference
   `${env:NAME}` in `weave.toml`. The daemon reads `NAME` from its
   own environment when it starts the MCP server. Keep secrets in
   your shell profile or your `.envrc`, never commit them.

2. **Inline** (only for non-secret config like flags). Quote the
   value directly in the `env` table.

```toml
[tools.mcp_servers.claude-flow.env]
# Pass-through (preferred for secrets).
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "${env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
# Inline (non-secret).
CLAUDE_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL = "info"
```

## Internal vs external

`internalOnly = true` (the default) means the MCP session is created
and tracked, but the server's tools are NOT registered in the main
`ToolRegistry`. Skills opt-in to specific tools per-turn via their
`allowed-tools` list (see `mcp-integration.md` §4). This keeps the
LLM's context window from being flooded with hundreds of unrelated
tool schemas.

Set `internalOnly = false` only for small, focused servers whose
tools the agent should see in every request.

## Removing or disabling a server

```bash
# Remove from weave.toml
weft mcp remove claude-flow

# Or hand-edit and just delete the table.
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`weft mcp list` shows the server with status `failed`**: check
  `.weftos/runtime/kernel.log` for the handshake error. The most
  common causes are a wrong `command` path, a missing env var, or
  the upstream server not implementing
  `protocolVersion = "2025-06-18"`. The daemon now warns and
  rejects on protocol-version mismatch (WEFT-489) — see
  `mcp-integration.md` for the supported set.

- **Tools don't appear in the LLM context**: this is expected for
  `internalOnly = true` servers. The session is up, but a skill
  must opt in via `allowed-tools`. Inspect with
  `weft skill show <skill-name>`.

- **Allowlist rejects a tool you expect to be callable**: the
  PermissionFilter (WEFT-189 / WEFT-480) gates `tools/list` and
  `tools/call` on `tools.allowed_tools`. If you set that list,
  every tool you want to expose has to match a glob there. Empty
  list = back-compat permissive behavior.
