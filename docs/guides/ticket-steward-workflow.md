# Ticket steward workflow

The steward runs beside each authoritative project board. It examines every
ticket on a bounded sweep, collects evidence, decides whether the current
status and assignee still match the work, and records a durable receipt. The
portfolio dashboard receives the source board's published snapshot only after
the source change is confirmed. A subscribed item is never a write target.

## Authority by board

| Board | Steward write path | Portfolio update |
|---|---|---|
| WeftOS and other native dashboard boards | Project-scoped harness credential and conditional ticket action | Already native; no snapshot |
| BakeOS OS board | Native machine transition command for allowed transitions; staff approves reassignment | Host-local snapshot publisher |
| Sansone Product Board | Existing product-board steward lane, respecting protected cards and machine-write policy | Host-local approved publisher |
| FlipsOS native board | Native ticket store with a dedicated machine actor and revision check | Project snapshot publisher |
| Shasta restoration board | Its own `/board` writer after an adapter exists | Restoration subscription publisher |

Other projects use the same contract when a board is enrolled. A project
registration must name exactly one source board and one authorized writer.
The dashboard's subscription token is publish-only and is not a source-board
credential.

## Per-ticket state machine

Persist a run keyed by `(project, ticket ID, source revision, evidence digest)`.
The ledger belongs to the source project and survives process restarts.

1. **Observed:** read one source ticket, its events, comments, linked work, and
   available receipts. Record the source revision and last observed time.
2. **Assessed:** save an evidence bundle with source URLs/IDs, timestamps,
   digest, proposed status and assignee, reason, and policy outcome. An absent
   or stale receipt is not proof of completion. A merged PR alone does not
   establish delivery. Never invent an owner from ticket text.
3. **Queued or ready:** send ambiguous or policy-restricted changes to the
   responsible person. Deterministic changes may advance only if the project's
   transition policy explicitly allows the machine action. An unchanged ticket
   gets a checked receipt so every ticket has sweep coverage.
4. **Applying:** re-read the source revision, then use its authorized writer
   with a compare-and-swap precondition and a stable action key. If the source
   changed, discard the proposal and reassess. A local mutex alone cannot
   protect two WeftOS nodes.
5. **Source confirmed:** read the ticket again and verify the target state and
   source event ID. If a crash occurs after the write, this read lets the next
   run recognize the committed action instead of repeating it.
6. **Publishing:** issue a full source-board snapshot via the project's
   existing publisher; verify the dashboard's acknowledged snapshot/count and
   record its ID. A failed publish stays pending and retries without rewriting
   the source ticket.
7. **Complete:** store the final receipt with actor, policy version, evidence
   digest, source revision/event, and dashboard snapshot. Subsequent sweeps
   can reassess when new evidence or a new source revision arrives.

The ledger's transitions are monotonic. Failed steps retain an error, attempt
count, and next retry time. Use exponential backoff with a cap, dead-letter
after repeated authorization or schema failures, and show pending publication
separately from pending source action. Sweep cursors are durable and paginate
the entire board; deletion or status filters must not silently skip tickets.

## Decision policy

- Move `todo` to `in_progress` only with an accepted claim or source work-start
  receipt. Move `in_progress` to `review` only when implementation and required
  local checks have a concrete receipt. Move to `done` only with accepted review
  and the project-specific delivery evidence. Reopen when an explicit source
  regression or human decision supersedes the prior completion.
- Reassignment requires an explicit accepted owner or handoff event and a
  project writer permitted to change the assignee. BakeOS machine workers do
  not perform human-only assignee edits.
- Cite exact evidence in each proposal. A model may summarize and rank
  evidence, but cannot authorize a transition. When evidence conflicts, queue
  a review and leave source status and assignee unchanged.
- Protected or client-confidential cards follow source export policy. A
  dashboard receipt may contain only the source-approved projection.

## Operational checks

Schedule a bounded sweep in each project, and allow manual `--once` replay.
Track total scanned, unchanged, queued, applied, conflicts, source errors,
pending publication, last successful sweep, and oldest unreviewed ticket.
Alert on a stuck cursor, repeated write conflicts, or snapshot lag. Test
crashes at the source-write and publish boundaries, two-node races, revoked
credentials, and a ticket edited by a person between assessment and apply.

The first implementation pass should establish the ledger and conservative
decision path on native dashboard, BakeOS, Sansone, and FlipsOS boards. Shasta
restoration remains queued until its source writer supports conditional
actions. No steward should report a project as active merely because its
snapshot subscription exists.

## Native dashboard runner

`node scripts/ticket-steward.mjs --decisions <file>` scans every ticket visible
to the selected `wfb_` credential and writes a mode-600 checkpoint at
`~/.local/state/weftos/ticket-steward.json`. Add `--apply` to send approved
changes to the conditional source API. The credential remains in the usual
mode-600 board token file. Run one instance per project credential and set
`WEFTOS_STEWARD_STATE_FILE` to a different host-local path for each project.

The decisions file has `schema: 1` and a `decisions` array. Each decision names
`ticket_id`, `expected_status`, `expected_updated_at`, `action` (`status` or
`assign`), `value`, `authorization: "human"`, `approved_by`, and `evidence` with
a reason and typed HTTPS references. The current rules require a claim for
work start, change plus checks for review, review plus delivery for done, a
regression for reopening, or an accepted handoff for reassignment. A decision
without those receipts is queued. This first runner treats supplied references
as attestations and requires a named human approval; it cannot yet verify the
linked artifacts independently. Its source action key is stable across crash
replay, while the dashboard RPC checks the source revision and deduplicates a
successful action. The next step is source-specific evidence verifiers and a
schedule under each project's process manager.
