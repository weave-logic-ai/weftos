# Kernel Operator Guide

This guide is the operator-facing entry point to the WeftOS kernel
(`clawft-kernel`) as it ships in 0.7.0. It covers the boot sequence,
the kernel services that an operator interacts with, the K-phase
status as of 0.7.0, governance and ExoChain auditing at the
operator level, and the day-to-day log lines that show up under
normal operation (including the DEMOCRITUS "still stuck" warning
that has historically been mistaken for a bug).

For developer-facing material — adding modules, extending traits,
unit-testing the kernel — see the WeftOS docs site at
[`docs/src/content/docs/weftos/kernel-guide.mdx`](../src/content/docs/weftos/kernel-guide.mdx).

For the architectural rationale behind the kernel, see ADR-049
(`docs/adr/adr-049-weftos-kernel.md`) and ADR-048 (Kernel Phase
Responsibilities).

## What the Kernel Is

`clawft-kernel` is the runtime that supervises agents, brokers IPC,
maintains the ExoChain audit log, enforces three-branch governance,
runs the DEMOCRITUS cognitive tick, and (optionally) the K6 mesh.
It is the same binary on every node — the operating mode is selected
by configuration (see ADR-042: Three Operating Modes).

The kernel runs as a long-lived daemon. The CLI front-ends (`weft`
and `weaver`) are thin clients: they enqueue commands over the
kernel's RPC socket and the kernel does the actual work, logs the
event to the chain, and routes any outbound traffic. ADR-021 (CLI
Kernel Compliance) is the load-bearing rule: **no CLI command
should bypass the daemon for state-changing operations**. If you
see a command that does, file it as a bug.

---

## Boot Sequence

Boot is a strict state machine driven by `Kernel::boot()` in
`crates/clawft-kernel/src/boot.rs`. An operator should expect to
see the following phases in order, each emitting a `BootEvent` that
is chain-logged when ExoChain is enabled:

| Phase | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Configuration loaded; feature gates evaluated; logging set up. |
| 1 | Process table + supervisor initialized (K1). |
| 2 | IPC + A2A router + topic router come up (K2). |
| 3 | Service registry started; default `SystemService`s (cron, health, etc.) registered (K2). |
| 3.5 | ExoChain primed: chain manager, tree manager, gate backends. |
| 4 | WASM tool runner ready (K3, behind `wasm-sandbox`). |
| 4.5 | Container manager (K4, behind `containers`). |
| 5a | App framework (K5) loads `weftapp.toml` manifests. |
| 5b | ECC substrate (K3c, behind `ecc`): causal graph, HNSW, calibration, cognitive tick. |
| 5d | Mesh networking (K6, behind `mesh`): listeners, peer discovery, heartbeat. |
| 6 | Kernel transitions to `Running`. |

A clean boot ends with `kernel state: Running` and a chain entry
of kind `kernel.boot.complete`. Anything earlier than that without
a corresponding entry means the boot stalled — `weaver kernel logs`
will show where.

---

## K-Phase Status (0.7.0)

K0–K5 are complete; K6 is at Phase 1. The full status table —
including which subsystem each phase owns and what is deferred —
lives in [`docs/weftos/k-phases.md`](../weftos/k-phases.md).

| Phase | Status | Highlights |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| K0    | Complete | Boot state machine, config, feature gates. |
| K1    | Complete | Process table, agent supervisor, RBAC. |
| K2    | Complete | IPC, A2A, topics, cron, services, health. |
| K2b   | Complete | Hardening: GovernanceGate, signed agent.spawn/exit/restart. |
| K2.1  | Complete | Symposium decisions: SpawnBackend, dual-signing scaffolding, ServiceEntry, MessageTarget::Service. |
| K3    | Complete | Wasmtime sandbox, fuel metering, ServiceApi, dual-layer A2ARouter gate. |
| K3c   | Complete | ECC: causal DAG, HNSW, cognitive tick, EML. |
| K4    | Complete | Container lifecycle, ChainAnchor trait + MockAnchor. |
| K5    | Complete | App framework, manifest install/start/stop, namespaced agents/tools. |
| K6    | Phase 1   | Types, traits, TCP/WS transport, 136 tests. Replication / split-brain handling deferred. |

## Operator-Facing Subsystems

### ExoChain (audit log)

ExoChain is the tamper-evident, hash-chained audit log behind every
state-changing operation in the kernel. It is enabled by default in
the 0.7.0 native binary. By default the chain lives at
`chain.rvf` in the kernel's runtime directory, signed with `chain.key`
next to it (see "Runtime directory" and "Chain storage location"
below). Operator commands:

```bash
weaver chain status          # current chain head, length, last entry kind
weaver chain verify          # walk the chain and verify hashes / signatures
weaver chain export <path>   # export to JSON for offline review
```

Per ADR-022 (ExoChain Mandatory Audit), every privileged operation
should produce a chain entry. If you run an action and `weaver chain
status` does not show a new entry, that is a regression — file it.

#### Runtime directory

Every runtime file of a kernel hangs off one root, resolved by one
function (`clawft_types::runtime_paths::RuntimePaths`, ADR-103 D4). The
socket, PID file, log, lock, `node.key`, chain files, anchor ledger,
`workloads.json`, `cluster_peers.json`, `apps.json` and
`revoked_hosts.json` all live directly under it.

Root resolution, highest first:

1. `$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`, when set and non-empty (full isolation for
   tests, probes and nested instances).
2. `<project>/.weftos/runtime`, where `<project>` is the nearest ancestor
   of the working directory that is a project root: it has
   `.weftos/project.toml`, or `.weftos/weave.toml`, or `weave.toml` next
   to a `.weftos/` directory (what `weaver init` creates), or an existing
   `.weftos/runtime/` directory, or a `.weftos/` directory in a git
   top-level (a `.git` file or directory, which covers git worktrees, so
   each worktree gets its own kernel). A bare `.weftos/` is not a project,
   and the walk never returns `$HOME`, so the `~/.weftos/` that holds apps
   and models is ignored.
3. `~/.clawft/` (legacy).

Legacy chain: the chain used to resolve from `$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` or
`~/.clawft` only, even for a project-local daemon. A kernel that resolves
to a project root with no chain yet, while `~/.clawft/chain.*` exists,
keeps using the legacy chain and its key and logs a WARN naming both
paths; starting a fresh genesis there would fork the history. Nothing is
moved until you run `weaver migrate user-chain` (below). To start a
fresh chain at the project path instead, run
`weaver kernel start --new-chain` (the legacy chain is left untouched), or
pin `kernel.chain.checkpoint_path`. A fresh chain is otherwise created
only when no chain exists at all. `weaver kernel start` reports success
only once the daemon serves (its socket accepts connections and
`kernel.pid` holds the spawned child's pid); if boot fails (for example the
chain lock is held) it prints the last log lines and exits non-zero. If the
daemon is still booting after 90 s (a large chain can take longer), it
prints "still starting (pid N); check `weaver kernel status`" and exits 0
without the started banner.

The Seed token store under `~/.clawft/secrets/` is read from there, with
a WARN, when the project has none yet; it is never moved automatically.

Migrating to the legacy chain safely: older kernels take no `chain.lock`,
so a new kernel cannot tell whether one is still writing
`~/.clawft/chain.*`. The first adoption is therefore explicit:

1. Stop every older weaver daemon (check `ps` or `weaver doctor daemon`).
2. Run `weaver kernel start --adopt-legacy-chain` once. It adopts the
   legacy chain and creates `chain.lock` beside it; later starts adopt it
   normally without the flag.
3. Or run `weaver kernel start --new-chain` for a fresh chain at the
   project path.

Without the flag (and with no `chain.lock` yet) the start is refused. Even
with the flag it is refused if the chain was modified within the last 120
seconds ("looks in use by an older kernel").

Migrating the legacy chain to the user chain: `weaver migrate user-chain
[--dry-run] [--from DIR] [--to DIR]` (defaults `~/.clawft` to
`~/.weftos/chain`). Stop every daemon that uses the legacy chain first.
It refuses if a kernel holds `chain.lock` or the chain was modified in the
last 120 s with no lock; takes the source `chain.lock` for the run; copies
`chain.rvf`, `chain.json`, `chain.key`, `chain.tree.json` and
`chain/anchors.jsonl` to a temp dir beside the destination with fsync;
restores the copy with the kernel's own loader and checks file hashes,
event count, head hash, integrity and the RVF signature against the
source; then renames it into place and writes `MIGRATED_FROM.json` there
and `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` beside the source. The source chain files are
never modified. Re-running is a no-op ("already migrated"); a destination
that holds a different chain is refused. `--dry-run` writes nothing. After
migration a boot that would still land on the migrated legacy chain is
refused unless `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` isolates it or `--adopt-legacy-chain`
is passed (WARN: that forks history). Rollback: delete the destination
directory and `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` beside the legacy chain; the legacy
chain is intact. A chain with no `chain.key`, or whose signature cannot be verified
against it, is refused unless `--allow-unsigned` is passed. If the marker write fails the command
exits non-zero; re-run it to finish.

Chain lock: whichever chain is in use is guarded by an exclusive lock
(`chain.lock` beside it) for the kernel's lifetime. A second kernel on the
same chain refuses to boot, naming the holder's PID.

Single instance: the daemon holds an exclusive advisory lock on
`<root>/kernel.lock` for its lifetime. A second kernel on the same root
exits non-zero with `another kernel owns <root> (pid N)`. With the lock
held, a leftover `kernel.sock` that refuses connections is unlinked and
rebound; one that accepts connections is never taken over.

When the CLI cannot reach a kernel it names the socket it tried and
whether there is no socket file, a stale socket (connection refused) or a
permission problem. State-changing commands do not fall back silently:
`weft agent` requires `--local` to run in-process, and `weft cron
add/remove/enable/disable` fail without a daemon (`weft cron run` is not
implemented by the kernel).
Read-only commands may still read local files and say so on stderr.

#### Chain storage location (isolated runtimes)

The kernel resolves the chain checkpoint path once at boot and derives
the other chain files from it by extension:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `chain.json` | JSON checkpoint (fallback format) |
| `chain.rvf` | RVF checkpoint (primary, signed) |
| `chain.key` | Ed25519 chain signing key (created on first boot) |
| `chain.tree.json` | Resource-tree checkpoint |
| `chain/anchors.jsonl` | External-anchor ledger, when anchoring is on |

Resolution order, highest first:

1. An explicit path in config: `kernel.chain.checkpoint_path` (and
   `kernel.chain.external_anchor.ledger_path` for the anchor ledger).
2. The runtime root (see "Runtime directory"): `$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`
   when set, else the project's `.weftos/runtime`, else `~/.clawft/`.
   The files go in `<root>/chain.json`, `<root>/chain.rvf` and so on.

Probe, demo and test daemons must run with `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`
pointing at a scratch directory. They still chain every action, but to
their own chain file and signing key under that directory, never to the
operator chain. The boot log shows the location that was picked:

```bash
WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR="$(mktemp -d)" weaver kernel start
weaver kernel logs | grep 'Chain storage'
```

Test code gets the same isolation: kernel unit tests pin a fresh temp
dir per boot, and integration tests build their config with
`ChainConfig::isolated_in(<tempdir>)`. The regression test is
`crates/clawft-kernel/tests/chain_runtime_isolation.rs`. It boots a
kernel with a fake `HOME` and `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` set, then checks
that the fake operator `chain.rvf` and `chain.key` are byte-identical
afterwards and that the isolated chain holds the new events.

#### Operator note: stray demo events from 2026-09-29

Before this isolation landed, `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` moved the daemon's
socket, PID file and log but not its chain. While card
mesh-placement-06 was being built, a demo daemon started with
`WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` appended about 70 events to the operator chain at
`~/.clawft/chain.rvf`.

The same isolation work found a wider source of stray events. Until
this fix, three tests booted a kernel with `chain: None`:

- `crates/clawft-kernel/tests/feature_composition.rs`
- `crates/clawft-kernel/tests/e2e_integration.rs` (through
  `minimal_kernel_config()`)
- `crates/weftos/src/lib.rs` (`weftos_boots_and_reports_state`)

`chain: None` falls back to the default chain under `~/.clawft`, so
each of those tests loaded the operator chain on shutdown, appended its
own boot events, and saved it back (`chain.rvf` and `chain.tree.json`;
`chain.key` was not changed). As a result, every
`scripts/build.sh test clawft-kernel` or gate run on the machine before
this fix added test boot events to the operator chain. That includes the
runs on 2026-09-29, the last at about 15:48 local time. The tests now
use an isolated chain (`ChainConfig::isolated_in(tempdir)`).

The operator decided to **leave these events in place**. The chain is
append-only and hash-linked, so removing entries would break
verification for every later event. Do not try to rewrite or truncate
the chain to get rid of them. They are real entries recording demo
activity, not corruption.

To tell them apart from operator activity, look for events that are
all timestamped 2026-09-29 (the mesh-placement-06 build window) and
match these patterns:

- source `app`, kinds `app.install`, `app.start`, `app.stop` and
  `app.remove`, with payload `app_name` set to the demo app (`demo-app`
  in the card's fixtures);
- source `workload`, kinds `workload.*` (for example `workload.install`
  and `workload.start`), from the same demo run;
- the boot, governance-gate and shutdown events the demo daemon itself
  wrote in the same time window, next to the `app` and `workload`
  events.

To review them without changing anything, export the chain and filter
the export. The JSON export is a top-level array of
`{sequence, chain_id, timestamp, source, kind, hash}` records, with
timestamps in RFC 3339 UTC. Widen the date filter by a few hours if
your local day straddles midnight UTC:

```bash
weaver chain export --format json --output chain-review.json
jq '.[] | select(.timestamp | startswith("2026-09-29"))
    | select(.source == "app" or .source == "workload")
    | {sequence, timestamp, source, kind}' chain-review.json
```

The JSON export does not include payloads. To confirm that an `app.*`
event names the demo app, look it up by sequence in
`weaver chain local --count 200`. The stray events form contiguous
sequence runs, so the boot and gate events around them belong to the
same demo daemon.

### User daemon (Phase 1)

ADR-103 Phase 1 adds a per-user daemon that collapses the `machine` and
`user` roles into one process. It serves every project of one user; the
project-local runtime (`<project>/.weftos/runtime/`) keeps working
unchanged until Phase 2.

```bash
weaver kernel start --profile user     # or WEAVER_PROFILE=user
weaver kernel status --profile user
weaver kernel stop --profile user      # restart likewise
```

`--profile` is global to `weaver kernel`, so `stop`, `restart` and
`status` resolve the same root as `start`. Without it everything behaves
as before.

| Item | User profile |
|------|--------------|
| Runtime root | `~/.weftos/run/` (socket, `kernel.pid`, `kernel.log`, `kernel.lock`, `node.key`). The project walk-up is never used; `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` still overrides for isolation. |
| One per user | The `kernel.lock` in that root. A second start exits nonzero naming the holder's pid. |
| Config | `~/.weftos/weave.toml` layered over the legacy `~/.clawft/config.json`, so the `.toml` wins on conflict. The working directory is set to `~/.weftos`, so a project-local `weave.toml` or `.clawft/config.json` is not picked up. An explicit `--config FILE` is used as-is. |
| Chain | `~/.weftos/chain/` when it exists (written by `weaver migrate user-chain`). Otherwise the legacy `~/.clawft` chain under the Phase 0 guard: the first start needs `--adopt-legacy-chain`, and the daemon never starts a silent fresh genesis. `--new-chain` starts a fresh `~/.weftos/chain/` and leaves the legacy chain untouched. |
| Projects | On start the manifest store `~/.weftos/projects/` is seeded from `~/.clawft/workspaces.json` (idempotent). |

The plan's decision D-1 applies: until Phase 3 the user key is the
chain key (`chain.key`). The handshake reports its id (the node-id-style
hash of the chain verifying key) as `user_key_id`. It becomes
`~/.weftos/user.key` in Phase 3.

#### Handshake in `kernel.status`

`kernel.status` carries the same payload as `kernel.handshake` (which
stays for compatibility) under a `handshake` key:

```json
{"state": "running", "...": "...",
 "handshake": {
   "proto": {"current": 1, "min": 1},
   "node_id": "<32 hex>", "user_id": "501", "user_key_id": "<32 hex>",
   "profile": "user", "roles": ["machine", "user"],
   "project_id": null, "bound_via": "none",
   "runtime_dir": "/Users/me/.weftos/run", "pid": 4242,
   "version": "0.8.1", "sha": "...", "binary": "..."}}
```

`user_id` is the local uid and is unverified in Phase 1 (peer
credentials arrive in Phase 3). A default daemon leaves `profile`,
`roles`, `user_id` and `user_key_id` empty. `weaver kernel status`
prints the profile, runtime root, bound project, node, user and
protocol.

#### `project.*` RPCs

| Method | Capability | Params |
|--------|------------|--------|
| `project.list` | Read | none |
| `project.show` | Read | `{id}` or `{root}` |
| `project.register` | Admin | `{root, name?}` |

They read and write the manifests in `~/.weftos/projects/`.
`project.register` adopts an absolute, existing project root exactly
like `weft project init`: an existing `project.toml` id wins, a seeded
manifest is adopted, else a ULID is minted. It refuses a relative root,
`/`, `$HOME`, and a root whose id is registered for another live root
(`root_conflict`). Errors carry `error_kind`: `project_not_found`,
`invalid_project`, `bad_root`, `root_conflict`, `invalid_params`.

#### Owner migration (one machine, in this order)

1. **Install the new binaries.** Nothing signals old daemons.
2. **Stop every older daemon**, from its own project directory with its own
   binary (`weaver kernel stop`, or `kill`). Confirm with `lsof -i :9470`
   that the mesh port is free and that no `kernel.pid` remains. This must
   precede the chain copy: the migration refuses a locked or recently
   written chain, but it cannot see a writer that uses a different runtime
   dir.
3. **Check `~/.clawft/config.json`.**
   - If it sets `kernel.chain.checkpoint_path`, remove it or point it at the
     migrated location. An explicit path bypasses the chain guards; one that
     points into a migrated directory is refused at boot (exit 78) unless
     `--adopt-legacy-chain` is passed, and `weaver migrate user-chain` warns.
   - Check `gateway.host`. The default is now `127.0.0.1` (with a `Host`
     check); set `0.0.0.0` only if you want LAN exposure.
4. **Create `~/.weftos/weave.toml`.** Copy the `[kernel.mesh]` and Noise
   settings from the old project's `weave.toml`. Without it the user daemon
   runs with the mesh off and the old daemon's mesh peers see it disappear.
5. **Migrate the chain.** Run `weaver migrate user-chain --dry-run` and read
   the plan (five files, the head seq and hash, signature `verified`), then
   run it without `--dry-run`. Afterwards `~/.weftos/chain/` holds the chain
   and `MIGRATED_FROM.json`, and `~/.clawft/` holds `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt`;
   the source bytes are unchanged. It is refused if `chain.key` is missing
   or the signature does not verify; `--allow-unsigned` overrides that and is
   not recommended.
6. **Start the user daemon** with `weaver kernel start --profile user`. If
   you skipped step 5 and the legacy chain is still in use, add
   `--adopt-legacy-chain` the first time. `weaver kernel status --profile
   user` should show profile `user`, roles `machine, user`, runtime
   `~/.weftos/run` and project `(unbound)`.
7. **Optional: run it as a service.** Run
   `weaver service unit --kind launchd --out ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.weftos.user.plist`
   (or `--kind systemd`), then the printed `launchctl bootstrap` line. Stop
   the foreground daemon first; the lock refuses two user daemons. After
   that `weaver update --restart` restarts through the service manager. A
   refused boot exits 78; systemd does not retry it
   (`RestartPreventExitStatus=78`), launchd retries every 30 s, so read the
   log if the service keeps cycling.
8. **Register each project** with `weft project init` (adopts the seeded
   manifest and prints the ULID), then `weft project show .`. `weft` reaches
   the user daemon from a registered project directory, or from anywhere
   once `~/.weftos/run` has a daemon, with no `--runtime`.
9. **What to expect afterwards.**
   - `weaver kernel start` in a project without flags is refused (exit 78)
     while it would land on a migrated legacy chain. Only two flags override
     it: `--adopt-legacy-chain`, which forks history, or `--new-chain`, which
     starts a fresh project chain.
   - Against the user daemon, mutating commands outside a project return
     `project_required` (`read_only`). The log streams, `substrate.read`,
     `cluster.facts` and `voice.trace` that the egui tray and
     `weft voice watch` use are allowed; `ipc.subscribe_stream` needs a
     project.
10. **Tokens.** `weft token issue` prints a `wft_` secret once, plus a
    playground link; `weft token list|revoke` manage them. Literal `auth`
    scopes work only from the daemon's uid on the unix socket.

Rollback:

1. `weaver kernel stop --profile user`.
2. Remove `~/.weftos/chain` and `~/.clawft/MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` (the
   marker, otherwise the old daemon is refused).
3. Restart the old daemon with the old binary in its project directory.

The `~/.clawft` chain files are byte-identical; that directory only gained
`chain.lock` (and `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` until you remove it).

### Governance (three-branch)

Governance is a permission-and-deferral layer in front of the chain.
ADR-033 (Three-Branch Governance) defines the model: legislative
(rules / capabilities), executive (the running agent / service), and
judicial (post-hoc review of `Defer` outcomes). Effects are scored
via the `EffectAlgebra` (ADR-034) so high-blast-radius actions can
be auto-deferred for human review.

```bash
weaver governance status            # current rule set summary
weaver governance pending           # actions Deferred and awaiting review
weaver governance review <id>       # accept or reject a deferred action
```

### Process table & supervisor (K1)

```bash
weaver agent list                  # PID / name / state for every agent
weaver agent inspect <pid>         # capabilities, parent PID, recent events
weaver agent spawn <type>          # spawn a new agent (subject to RBAC)
weaver agent stop <pid>            # graceful stop (SIGTERM-equivalent)
weaver agent restart <pid>         # supervised restart, chain-logged
```

### Health & lifecycle

```bash
weaver kernel start                # bring the kernel up
weaver kernel stop                 # graceful shutdown (drains agents)
weaver kernel status               # boot state + uptime
weaver health                      # aggregated health across services
weaver kernel logs                 # last N boot/runtime events
```

### Windows transport (WEFT-11 + WEFT-559)

Local RPC uses a platform transport in `clawft-rpc` / `clawft-weave`:

| Platform | Transport | `DaemonClient::connect` | Daemon accept loop |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Unix     | UDS `kernel.sock` under the runtime dir | Connects or returns `None` | Wired (`clawft-weave::daemon`) |
| Windows  | Named pipe `\\.\pipe\clawft-kernel-<hash>` derived from the logical socket path | Connects or returns `None` (WEFT-11) | Wired (WEFT-559) |
| Other    | — | Always `None`; `call` errors clearly | N/A |

- Path derivation: `pipe_name_for_path(socket_path())` — project-local
  runtimes stay isolated the same way UDS paths do.
- Server helpers: `create_listener` / `create_listener_next` in
  `clawft_rpc::named_pipe`; the daemon accept loop re-creates the next
  instance after each client connects.
- `weaver kernel start` (background or `--foreground`), `stop` (RPC
  `kernel.shutdown` then `taskkill`), and `restart` (stop+start) work
  on Windows. cargo-dist includes `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Residual: soak-test the named-pipe roundtrip and release artefacts on
  a Windows host / `windows-latest` CI (see build guide).

Details:
[`weftos-deferred-requirements.md`](./weftos-deferred-requirements.md)
(Windows transport section).

### Mesh (K6)

When the `mesh` feature is enabled, the kernel also listens on a
mesh transport for cross-node IPC, chain replication, and SWIM
heartbeats (ADR-039). The mesh runs as a phase-5d boot step and is
configured under `[kernel.mesh]` in `~/.clawft/config.json`.

Transports (selectable via `transport`):

| Value | Backend | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `tcp` (default) | `TcpTransport` | Dev / UDP-blocked nets |
| `ws` / `websocket` | `WsTransport` | Browser / proxy-friendly |
| `quic` | `QuicTransport` (quinn) | ADR-026 primary; needs `quic` feature + **UDP** |

Application crypto is optional Noise (`noise = true`, snow XX). See
[mesh-quic.md](./mesh-quic.md) for QUIC config, firewall, and tests.

```bash
weaver mesh status                 # peer count, view, listener address
weaver mesh peers                  # detailed peer table with last-heard timestamps
```

## DEMOCRITUS Cognitive Tick

DEMOCRITUS (named for the atomist; see ADR-047 Self-Calibrating
Tick) is the kernel's cognitive loop. It runs behind the `ecc`
feature flag and drives the ECC substrate through a SENSE → THINK
(fast EML) → DETECT DRIFT → THINK (exact RFF) → LOG → COMMIT cycle.
Operators encounter DEMOCRITUS in two places:

1. **Boot logs**: at phase 5b you will see lines like
   `DEMOCRITUS: tick interval calibrated to N ms` and
   `DEMOCRITUS: causal graph idle`.
2. **Runtime logs**: periodic INFO/WARN lines describing causal
   activity, drift detection, and cycle / stuck-state warnings.

### Reading the "still stuck" log line

`crates/clawft-kernel/src/cognitive_tick.rs` emits a `WARN` line of
the form:

```
DEMOCRITUS: still stuck after N checks: Stuck { net_change: 0.0, ... }
```

(or `Oscillating { ... }`) when the cycle detector observes that the
λ₂ coherence history has flat-lined or oscillated for a window.
**This is not a bug** in the overwhelming majority of cases.

It happens during normal operation in three scenarios:

- **Empty causal graph**: the kernel boots, ECC is enabled, but no
  agent has yet produced an event for the cognitive tick to chew on.
  The graph is empty, so coherence does not move, and the cycle
  detector reports "stuck" exactly as designed. The `idle-graph
  gate` (post-v0.6.19) suppresses this in steady state, but transient
  empty-graph windows during boot still surface one or two warnings.
- **Idle conversation**: the operator-visible agent has not received
  a new prompt for many ticks. The graph stops growing, λ₂ stops
  changing, and the detector reports "stuck" until the next event
  perturbs the graph.
- **Steady-state convergence**: the conversation has settled into a
  stable attractor. From the cycle detector's point of view this is
  indistinguishable from "stuck"; from the operator's point of view
  this is healthy behaviour.

What v0.6.19 did about it:

- **Edge-triggered logging**: entering and leaving the stuck phase
  always log; in-phase repeats log on an exponential-backoff
  schedule (`stuck_checks_since_log` doubles after each warning,
  capped at 256 checks). You should see the warning *less often*
  the longer it persists, not more.
- **Idle-graph gate**: when `causal.node_count() == 0` the loop
  skips the cycle-detector branch entirely, so a freshly-booted
  kernel does not spam the warning before any event has landed.
- **Bounded coherence history**: the rolling window cannot grow
  without bound, so memory does not leak through long stuck
  phases.

When the warning *does* mean something:

- The warning fires *immediately on entry* with `ConversationState::Stuck`
  *and* you have an active conversation — i.e. messages are being
  produced but coherence is not moving. That suggests the agent is
  looping on itself or wedged on a thinking step.
- The warning fires every tick despite the backoff (it shouldn't —
  if it does, the backoff state machine is broken).
- The warning correlates with elevated tick latency in
  `weaver health` or with a flapping process under
  `weaver agent list`.

In all three of those cases, capture the surrounding chain entries
(`weaver chain export`) and file an issue. Otherwise: ignore the
line, or filter it at your log aggregator.

The cognitive-tick code that emits these lines is gated as of commit
`5f888a1a` (v0.6.19) — see the kernel-governance audit
(`.planning/reviews/0.7.0-release-gate/02-kernel-governance.md`,
"Open questions and known limitations") for the full backstory.

## Configuration

Operator-facing kernel configuration lives in
`~/.clawft/config.json` under the `kernel` key (with workspace and
project-level overlays per the
[Configuration Guide](./configuration.md)). The most-touched fields:

```jsonc
{
  "kernel": {
    "features": ["exochain", "ecc", "mesh"],
    "mesh": {
      "enabled": true,
      "transport": "tcp",
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:9489",
      "seed_peers": ["10.0.0.2:9489"]
    },
    "chain": {
      "path": "~/.clawft/chain"
    },
    "governance": {
      "default_policy": "permit",
      "deferral_threshold": 0.7
    },
    "ecc": {
      "tick_interval_ms": "auto",
      "stuck_suppress_cap": 256
    },
    "ipc_tcp": {
      "enabled": false,
      "listen": "127.0.0.1:9420"
    }
  }
}
```

The mesh listener defaults to port **9489** ("the weave"; ADR-103 D1) and
`listen_addr` is the configurable address (`listen` is accepted as an
alias). When `mesh.enabled` is true and the address cannot be bound, for
example because another kernel on the same machine already holds the port,
boot fails with an error naming the address. With `mesh.enabled = false`
nothing is bound and nothing fails.

A node's id is derived from its Ed25519 node key, not generated per boot:
`node_id = hex(SHA-256(pubkey)[..16])`, 32 hex characters (ADR-025, ADR-103
D11). The same id appears in the mesh handshake, cluster membership,
heartbeats and `kernel.status`, and it is stable across restarts while
`<runtime>/node.key` is kept.

See [`docs/weftos/kernel-modules.md`](../weftos/kernel-modules.md)
for the full per-module reference and `kernel-modules.md` for
which features pull in which crate dependencies.
