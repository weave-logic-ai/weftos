## [0.8.2] - 2026-10-04

### Highlights (0.8.2)

- **Seed licence proxy (ADR-106).** A Cognitum Seed holds the mesh's one
  licence, its token and its cogs; one licence covers the whole mesh and one
  checkout needs no further permission. New `weft-licence` crate (binding,
  run gate, steward relay, renewal), holder gating, and a start check in
  `weft-cog-host` that runs a licensed cog only from a sealed copy.
- **Appliance console (`weft-cog-manager`).**
  - Sensor detail with a guide-first install flow (ADR-107): pick a sensor,
    read its guide, pick a node, pre-check, install, post-check. Guides are
    bundled with the catalog, so they can be read before anything is
    installed.
  - Catalog grows to 556 items with a 71-manufacturer registry, Tools, and
    sensor-to-cog links. USB hardware identify and the hardware Dex.
  - The Network tab is now the fleet manager: one list of every machine and
    device from every source (mesh nodes from the daemon, Cognitum Seeds,
    tailnet hosts, ESP32 edge nodes), each labelled with where its facts came
    from.
  - Node detail: Overview, Workloads, Health (load, signed capacity, RTT and
    load sparklines), Trust / licence (with copyable admin commands the
    console never runs), Software / firmware, and Raw. Seed detail: identity,
    status, firmware slots, thermal.
  - It reaches the daemon through the gateway with a read-only token
    (`weft token issue --read-only`).
- **Fleet in the daemon.**
  - `fleet.snapshot` (Read) with per-field provenance, served at
    `GET /api/fleet/snapshot`; `weaver fleet status` and
    `weaver fleet location set`.
  - Verified peers ping each other: last pong, smoothed RTT and missed pongs
    are reported, and each pong carries the responder's load average, cores
    and memory. The daemon reports its own hostname.
  - Legacy UUID peer ids are dropped from `cluster_peers.json` on load.
- **Memory (opt-in).**
  - `agents.memory_recall`: inject at most 5 of 20 retrieved `MEMORY.md`
    snippets tagged `[m1]`… instead of the whole file. Cited snippets reward
    the reranker and ignored ones penalise it; the retriever is never trained
    (RMM retrospective, WEFT-732).
  - `agents.memory_consolidation`: distil conversations after each turn into
    topic nodes with merge-or-insert, so a corrected fact replaces the old
    one (RMM prospective, WEFT-733).
  - Both are off by default.
- **Spatial.** The daemon's `ecc.spatial.*` RPCs are back over the kernel
  spatial service: insert, get (with a JSON payload for provenance), query,
  branches, diff, events and a replay check.
- **Weave topology Phase 4 (ADR-103).**
  - Nested user instances (D10) with private identity, signed contracts and
    an owned liveness pipe. Projects stop with their nested instance.
  - Per-project sandboxes: `logical` (default), macOS `seatbelt`, and
    `linux_container`.
  - A dedicated child RPC endpoint with a method ceiling.
  - Certified leaves: signed publishing, ACK, discovery, offline replay, and
    an ESP-IDF producer with an NVS backlog.
- **Public cogs.** The first 11 WeftOS hardware cogs are published in their
  own repository (`weave-logic-ai/weftos-cogs`) with armv7 and aarch64
  cross-builds and the shared `cog-sensor-sources` crate.
- **Monitoring.** `/monitoring` shows real token counts, latency and failures,
  and the gateway shares the agent pipeline's routing history (WEFT-305).

### Known limits (0.8.2)

- The Linux-container project driver has not passed its real Docker-in-Docker
  acceptance run; treat `linux_container` as experimental.
- The Wasmtime project-kernel slice is not in this release.
- Certified leaf firmware is build-verified only: it has not been flashed to a
  device and no power-loss test has run.
- Legacy unsigned bare-metal leaves stay off by default.
- The owner migrations (`weaver migrate user-chain`, `weaver migrate user-key`,
  `weaver project migrate-kernel`, `weaver mesh install-service`) are
  implemented and tested on isolated state, but none has yet been run on a
  real installation. Follow `docs/guides/kernel.md` and
  `docs/guides/weftos-deployment-sops.md`, dry run first, and keep the source
  chain and keys.

### Security — `weaver update` verifies release signatures (fail closed)

- Release CI now signs every release: `scripts/release/sign-release.sh`
  writes `weftos-release.json` (the sha256 of every uploaded file,
  `dist-manifest.json` included) and `weftos-release.json.sig` (Ed25519, key
  from the `WEAVELOGIC_RELEASE_KEY` secret). With no key, the job fails and
  nothing is published.
- `weaver update` checks that signature against the compiled-in WeaveLogic
  release key (a dedicated key, `8ac2a301…`, separate from the COG-008 cog key)
  before reading anything else from
  the release. The signed tag must match the manifest, the manifest must match
  its signed hash, and every archive must match its signed hash. Unsigned or
  badly signed releases are refused, and so is a tampered archive with
  rehashed `.sha256` files. `--check` refuses them too.
- New flag `--insecure-skip-signature` (warns; sha256 checks still run) for
  emergencies. There is no runtime way to change the trusted key.
- No rollbacks: `--force` now only reinstalls the same version or confirms an
  install with no receipt. A release older than the running build, or older
  than the receipt's new `weftos_highest_version` mark, needs
  `--allow-downgrade` (warns). A downgrade never lowers the mark.
- A release key revoked in the operator's signer revocation list
  (`revoked_subjects.json`, as used for cogs) makes `weaver update` refuse
  everything and point to an out-of-band reinstall. The user-level lists
  (`$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`, else `~/.weftos/run` and `~/.clawft`) are read
  whatever the working directory, with a project's list added when there is
  one. A malformed project list warns and is ignored; a malformed user list
  is an error.
- The signed list carries a `published` time; a latest release signed over 90
  days ago gets a warning.
- The cog signer (`weft-cog-repo sign`, public and private repos) refuses
  payloads starting with `weftos-release-` and anything that is not an ELF,
  Mach-O or wasm binary, so a cog signature can never pass as a release
  signature.
- `release.yml` triggers only on `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*` tags, and its
  signing `host` job runs in the `weftos-cogs` GitHub Environment (v* tags
  only, a required reviewer, the signing secret held there).

### Changed — `weaver update` is sha256-checked, all-binary and install-method aware

- `weaver update` checks every archive's sha256 against the published `.sha256`
  (and `sha256.sum`) and `dist-manifest.json`, failing closed, then replaces
  `weft`, `weaver` and `weftos` together with per-file atomic renames and full
  rollback. The sha256 check alone gives integrity, not authenticity; release
  signatures (above) add authenticity.
- Archives are unpacked in-process: links, `..` and absolute paths are
  refused and unpacked size is capped. Downloads ignore `.curlrc` and CA
  environment overrides, accept https only, and follow at most 5 redirects.
- Homebrew, `cargo install`, source builds and system package paths are
  refused with the owning channel's command. An install with no cargo-dist
  receipt needs a confirmation or `--force`.
- New flags: `--check`, `--dry-run`, `--restart`, `--no-restart`. The daemon
  restart goes through launchd or systemd when the daemon runs under them and is
  never done under `sudo`. The `sudo cp` fallback is gone.

### Changed — gateway auth uses daemon tokens; no HTTP token mint (ADR-102)

- **Breaking:** `POST /api/auth/token` is gone (404). The gateway no longer
  hands out tokens or keeps a token store. Every `/api/*` route, `/ws`, `/mcp`
  and `/api/openapi.json` needs a bearer issued by the kernel daemon: run
  `weft token issue` (the daemon must be running). It prints a sign-in link
  `http://<host>:<api_port>/#token=<token>`; `weft ui` prints one too. Scripts
  that called the mint route must switch to `weft token issue`. Without a
  daemon, authenticated requests get 503, not 401.
- Project tokens (ADR-103) are refused by the gateway.
- `GET /api/health` is tiered: anonymous callers get only `{"status":"ok"}`
  (or 503 `degraded`); a valid token gets the full status document. The
  `/api/status` route is removed.
- New: `POST /mcp` (full MCP profile) and `GET /api/openapi.json` on the
  gateway, both behind the token.
- The gateway refuses to bind a non-loopback API address over plain HTTP
  unless `--dangerously-plain-http` or `gateway.dangerously_plain_http` is set
  (it has no TLS of its own). Loopback now means any loopback IP, including
  `127.0.0.0/8` and IPv4-mapped `::ffff:127.0.0.1`; this also tightens
  `weft mcp-server --listen`'s loopback test.
- `/mcp`, `/events`, `/custody/witness` and tokened `/api/health` are now
  rate-limited per client, and the gateway caps its own daemon token checks
  (about 50/s, burst 100; excess gets 429). `/mcp` calls are serialised with a
  10 s queue timeout and a 120 s call timeout.
- A token revoked with `weft token revoke` can keep working on a running
  gateway for up to 30 seconds. Open WebSockets are not closed on revoke or
  expiry.

### Changed — workload permits and policy files are stricter (upgrade note)

- The placement control plane now refuses to build, which takes down all
  `weaver workload place|explain|status|stop|logs|unload` until fixed, if
  any of these is true of a file in the runtime dir: a permit in
  `workload-permits.json` accepts `"min_package_trust": "unsigned"` and
  names no `"principals"`; a policy file (`workload-permits.json`,
  `workload-trust.json`, peers, container, seeds) is group- or
  world-writable (for example mode 0664); a policy file is owned by another
  user. `weaver workload revoke` keeps working in every one of these cases.
  Fix: `chmod 600 <runtime>/workload-*.json`, `chown` the files to the
  daemon's user, and add `"principals": ["catalog"]` to an unsigned permit
  for the catalog verbs. See docs/cogs/operator-guide.md.
- `workload install` / `unload` are decided by the permit gate as the
  principal `catalog` on `unsigned` packages (they were always denied).

### Added — `weaver workload revoke` and forced unload

- `weaver workload revoke --package|--signer|--hash` revokes, chains
  (`workload.revoke`, `workload.unrevoke`), stops and unloads what runs from
  the subject on this node and on peers that receive the signed notice.
  `WorkloadGate::new` / `with_rules` now take the revocation list.

### Added — cog manifest `redistributable` flag (ADR-100 amendment, ADR-099 section 6)

- The signed cog manifest has an optional `redistributable` field (default
  false; `weaver workload pack --redistributable`). Packages are seeded,
  advertised and served over the artifact swarm only when it is true and the
  package has no Cognitum provenance. Our own cogs need it to be shared.
- **Upgrade order:** `CogPackageBody` rejects unknown fields, so verifiers
  built before this change (v0.8.1 nodes, cog-repo, Seed tooling) reject a
  manifest signed with `redistributable = true`. Upgrade every verifier in a
  mixed-version mesh before packing with the flag. Manifests without it are
  unchanged.

### Changed — unverified mesh peers are not cluster members (ADR-103 A10)

- **Mode-dependent:** this applies only under `kernel.mesh.admission =
  "enforce"`. Under `observe` (the shipped default) and `off`, every peer
  joins as `Active` exactly as before: observe means observe, not enforce.
  `MeshRuntime::set_enforcing` carries the mode (set at boot, by the mesh
  service, and when an admin changes the mode).
- Under enforce, `MeshPeerEvent::Joined` and `Recovered` carry `verified`
  (true when the peer counts as a member). A peer admission did not verify
  (a dialled seed, a legacy leaf) is held in cluster membership as the new
  `NodeState::Unverified`, not `Active`: it keeps its routes, but is not in
  `active_peers()`, is not reported healthy, placement treats it as not alive
  and refuses to place on it, and the ruvector manager is not told about it.
  Heartbeats and `Suspect` events never promote it; only a verified join does.
  An `Unreachable` event, or an hour without a heartbeat, drops it from the
  list. Anything that treated "present in membership" as "member" should check
  for `Active`.
- `seed_peers` entries may be `address#node-id` to pin the id a seed must
  claim. A dialled seed with no pin is bound to the first id named by an
  envelope or an assessment frame; frames that name no id before that are
  dropped (assessment frames used to pass unbound).

### Changed — mesh connection limits and seed dials (ADR-103 A10)

- **Behaviour change:** the per-IP connection cap (default 64) and the
  first-frame timeout (default 10 s) now apply under every `kernel.mesh.admission`
  mode, not only `enforce`. A legacy leaf that connects and stays silent for
  more than 10 s is dropped, and one host can hold at most 64 connections.
  Tune them with `kernel.mesh.max_connections_per_ip` and
  `kernel.mesh.first_frame_timeout_secs` for the collapsed daemon, or with
  `max_connections_per_ip` and `first_frame_timeout_secs` in `mesh.toml` for the
  machine mesh service (also `weaver mesh install-service
  --max-connections-per-ip N --first-frame-timeout-secs S`, written only when
  given). The idle timeout and live revocation check remain `enforce`-only.
- Seed connections are now bidirectional, redial with jittered exponential
  backoff, drop after 5 minutes of inbound silence, and stop when the mesh
  service stops. There is no dial-side keepalive yet, so a seed that stays
  silent for 300 s flaps `Left`/`Joined` every 5 minutes.

### Changed — Chain authority follow-ups (ADR-103 A7)

- **Behaviour change:** the user daemon now exports its real `max_processes` and
  subagent `max_per_conv` as the parent policy's limits (they were empty). A
  project overlay that sets `limits.max_processes` or `limits.spawn_budget`
  above the parent's cap is refused at boot, reload and push with the parent
  value in the message; lower it to the parent cap or below.
- `auth.token` events and `governance.overlay.applied` are never replicated;
  chain sync stops cleanly at the first authority event (`StoppedAtAuthorityEvent`).
- Placement RPCs refuse after a `governance.parent.push` until the kernel
  restarts (`governance changed ... restart this kernel`): the placement gate is
  fixed at build time, so the older gate no longer decides after a push.

### Changed — Weave topology Phase 1 follow-ups (ADR-103 A8, next release 0.8.2)

- **Legacy clients are refused for mutating calls (breaking).** A request with
  no `proto` now gets `proto_mismatch` unless the method is read-only, and
  `weft`/`weaver` clients that meet a daemon with no `kernel.handshake` on the
  default endpoint send read-only calls only (`unverified_daemon` otherwise).
  Restart an old daemon with the current build to lift it. The gate is an
  allowlist (`READ_ONLY_METHODS`), not the capability table. Remote JSON
  clients on the TCP relay are not stamped by the relay: without `proto` they
  are read-only from 0.8.2; send `"proto": 1`. The VS Code panel and the
  child-kernel link now send it. Old no-`proto` clients that call
  `kernel.subscribe`, `substrate.subscribe` or `agent.chat` now fail with
  `proto_mismatch` (those are not on the read-only allowlist). Update the
  client.
- **launchd no longer cycles on a permanent refusal.** The user daemon writes
  `~/.weftos/run/REFUSED` on a permanent refusal or a clean exit and the
  generated plist's `KeepAlive` is `PathState {REFUSED: false}`. Only an
  instance launchd starts removes it on boot: the plist sets
  `WEFTOS_SERVICE_MANAGER=launchd`, and a manual `weaver kernel start
  --profile user` leaves the sentinel in place and prints a hint (otherwise
  launchd would launch its own, refused, instance beside the manual one every
  30 s). To hand control back, run `weaver kernel stop --profile user` and then
  `launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/ai.weftos.user`. A refused duplicate start
  never writes the sentinel, and a clean-exit write happens only if no
  successor holds the instance lock. launchd watches `~/.weftos/run/REFUSED`,
  so a `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` override is not supervised by launchd. Regenerate
  the unit with `weaver service unit --kind launchd` to pick up the new plist
  and its marker. The legacy-chain age-window refusal is now a plain boot error
  (exit 1, retried); `-cREL` is made absolute on SIGHUP re-exec.
- `weaver kernel status` without `--profile user` reports a live user daemon
  instead of booting an inspection kernel; `weft doctor` lists `~/.weftos/run`
  with the `kernel.lock` holder, `REFUSED`, the migration marker and adoption
  state; MCP attach messages and `is_daemon_running()` honour a manifest
  `runtime_dir`.

### Added — Weave topology follow-ups: identity, supervisor, mesh service (ADR-103 A7, A10, A13, A14)

- **User-key rotation.** `weaver migrate user-key --rotate` replaces
  `~/.weftos/user.key` with a dual-signed handover appended to
  `user-key-rotations.jsonl`; it needs the user daemon stopped and resumes after
  a crash. Material sealed by the old key keeps verifying up to the rotation
  point. `user_key_history_invalid` is the new fail-closed refusal when the
  rotation log does not end at the key in use. A running project kernel fails
  its next `mesh.register` (`pop_failed`) and is restarted by the supervisor's
  liveness pass, not re-certified. Restart children with `weaver kernel restart
  --project <id>` and run `weaver mesh bind rebind` afterwards (ADR-103 A13).
- **Anchor reset.** `weaver project anchor reset --project <id>` (RPC
  `project.anchor.reset`, Admin, user daemon only) opens a new anchor epoch after
  a project chain was moved aside, so the project's restarted anchors (`seq = 1`)
  are accepted instead of refused with `anchor_seq`. Within an epoch an anchor
  statement's `chain_id` must equal the last accepted one (`anchor_chain_id`).
- **Behaviour change:** a same-uid peer inside a supervised child's process
  group no longer gets the ADR-070 shortcut: its literal `auth: "admin"` is
  ignored and it is treated as anonymous (read and chat). Anything an agent runs
  inside a child kernel that relied on the shortcut against the user daemon now
  fails with permission denied. The owner's CLI is unaffected.
- `weft token issue --project` help and tests now state what a project-scoped
  token does: the token's project is the request's project and a different claim
  is `project_scope_mismatch`; it is a claim guard, not a capability limit.

### Changed — Supervisor liveness and shared slots (ADR-103 A7 S5-S8)

- **Behaviour change:** a `running` child whose registry session has stayed
  expired for 30 s (`lost_heartbeat_grace`, after three missed beats) is stopped
  and restarted inside its restart budget, then marked `failed`. An adopted
  child's tombstone session and a child whose last beat was busy are never
  treated as lost.
- `project.status`, `weaver kernel status` and `weaver doctor` report
  `stale_build` (`child:<id>:stale-build`) when a child runs another build than
  the user daemon. Nothing restarts it on its own.
- `weaver kernel start --legacy-project-daemon` is refused in a tree whose
  manifest says `via = child-kernel`; `project.stop` on an adopted-but-refused
  leftover answers `unmanaged_pid`.
- The four global shared-service slots are fair: a project holding a slot may not
  take another while a project holding none was refused within 3 s. `shared.*`
  re-checks on every call that the project is still registered and active.

### Changed — Mesh service journal and record publication (ADR-103 A10)

- **Behaviour change:** at start the service accepts a lone torn final journal
  line by itself (no newline, nothing readable, no earlier pending quarantine):
  it truncates the tail and journals `journal.accept_truncate` with
  `auto: "torn_tail"`, so the journal is modified at start. `status` reports
  `last_auto_accept`. Any other damage still quarantines and refuses to bind.
- `service.json` is published only after the socket is bound and a lost bind
  race never replaces the winner's record. `read_record` waits up to 2 s and
  retries for a record that is mid-write.
- `max_connections_per_ip` and `first_frame_timeout_secs` are `mesh.toml` keys;
  see the connection-limits entry above.

### Added — Weave topology Phase 2, per-project kernels (ADR-103 A7, package G)

- **Per-project child kernels under the user daemon.** `weaver kernel start
  --project <id|name>` (never starts the user daemon; it tells you the command),
  `weaver kernel stop --project | --all-children`, `weaver kernel restart
  --project`, and `project.start|stop|restart|status|ensure_running` on the
  user daemon. A project opts in with `weaver project migrate-kernel <id>
  [--dry-run|--revert]` (refuses while the project's own daemon runs; it is
  never signalled). `weft` commands start the child on demand for a project
  marked `via = "child-kernel"`. Idle children stop after `idle_stop_secs`
  (default 1800 for child-kernel projects).
- **Supervision:** crashes restart with 1 s to 30 s backoff inside a budget,
  then `failed` until `weaver kernel restart --project`; a clean exit is never
  restarted; children survive a user-daemon restart (`weaver update`) and are
  verified and adopted afterwards; unverifiable leftovers are listed, never
  signalled. `weaver doctor` reports failed, orphaned and unverified children.
- **Security:** a child starts with an allow-listed environment (no provider
  keys), `--profile project`, a signed parent policy, a pinned user key and a
  Write-only project token that may call only the shared services, the
  handshake and its own refresh. `project.revoke` stops the child, kills its
  token and is terminal.

### Changed (package G)

- A plain `weaver kernel start` inside a project, beside a running user daemon,
  is refused; pass `--legacy-project-daemon` for one more release. Running
  daemons are not affected by a restart.
- The launchd unit gains `AbandonProcessGroup` and the systemd unit
  `KillMode=process` so a service restart keeps project kernels. Regenerate
  the unit (`weaver service unit`) and reinstall it. Stopping the user daemon
  with `weaver kernel stop --profile user` stops its children first unless you
  pass `--keep-children`.

### Fixed — Weave topology Phase 2 integration (ADR-103 A7)

- **Security:** `human_approval_required = true` in a project's
  `overlay.toml` can no longer turn the parent's denies into approval prompts.
  The parent's blocking rules stay hard denies, and only actions the parent
  permits ask for approval.
- **Security:** callers can no longer append chain events under the kernel's
  own sources (`governance`, `project`, `project.supervisor`), and the
  governance rollback floor reads only the kernel's own records. Before, one
  forged `chain.append` could stop a project kernel from booting.
- `project.revoke` is now terminal for the project id: no key is certified for
  it again (`project_revoked`). Give the tree a new identity with
  `weft project init --fork --force`. If revoke or rekey fails late (the
  certificate file), it returns `identity_change_incomplete` and still stops
  the child and writes the marker.
- `weft project init` also ignores `.weftos/project.cert.json` and
  `.weftos/state/` in an existing `.gitignore`.
- **Read before downgrading:** a pre-Phase 2 `weaver` run against a
  `child-kernel` project starts a fresh chain over the project chain. Move
  `<root>/.weftos/chain/` aside first (kernel guide, "Never downgrade a
  child-kernel project").
- A project kernel now signs its chain with `project.key`. Before, it created
  a separate `chain.key` beside the checkpoint and its own one-key check then
  stopped it, so no real child could boot.
- A project kernel is bound to its project, and its `kernel.handshake` names
  it. Before, no real child got past the supervisor's readiness check. The
  user-signed forward header on the supervisor's graceful `kernel.shutdown`
  now verifies, and governance events on the child carry the project.
- `project.revoke` writes the terminal marker in the user daemon's run root
  (`$WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR` when set), where the supervisor and the child look
  for it. Before, the path came from the manifest store, so with a custom run
  root or store the marker was written where nothing read it.
- New end-to-end test (`tests/project_kernel_e2e.rs`). The user daemon runs in
  process and the child is the real `weaver kernel` code path. The test covers
  registration, the overlay deny, idle stop with the final anchor, restart on
  demand, three crashes then `failed`, `restart --project` and revoke.

### Changed — Weave topology Phase 0 (ADR-103) — read before upgrading

- **Stop every pre-0.8.2 daemon before first running the new build, and check
  it is gone** (`ps`, `weaver doctor daemon`). Older daemons take no
  `chain.lock`, so the new build cannot see them; the 120 s recency guard is a
  heuristic and turns off once a `chain.lock` exists.
- **One runtime resolver.** Socket, PID, log, `node.key`, chain, workloads,
  cluster peers and revocations all resolve from one root:
  `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`, else the nearest project marker above the working
  directory, else `~/.clawft`. `$HOME` is never a project. A project marker is
  `.weftos/` plus one of `project.toml`, `.weftos/weave.toml`, a `weave.toml`
  beside it, an existing `.weftos/runtime/`, or a `.git` (worktrees get their
  own kernel). The fallback to `.weftos/runtime/` files in the working
  directory is gone.
- **Chains are no longer forked or shared by accident.** A kernel with no chain
  of its own keeps using the legacy `~/.clawft` chain and its key, guarded by
  `chain.lock`. The first adoption of a legacy chain that no lock-aware kernel
  has used needs `weaver kernel start --adopt-legacy-chain`; `--new-chain`
  starts a fresh chain instead (refused when it would overwrite the legacy
  chain in `~/.clawft`). A second kernel on the same runtime root or chain is
  refused with the holder's PID. `kernel.lock` and `chain.lock` files appear.
- **Mesh node ids are now 32 hex characters**, `hex(SHA-256(pubkey)[..16])`,
  stable across restarts. They change on upgrade: re-pin peers, ACL rules and
  the mic node (`WHISPER_INPUT_NODE_ID` or `voice.mic_node_id`).
- **Mesh port 9489** by default (was 9470 in code, 9421 in docs). Update
  `listen_addr`, `seed_peers` and firewalls; the deployed Pi weaver stays on
  9470 until it is redeployed. A failed mesh bind now stops boot.
- **Mic source is fail-closed.** An operator pin wins; otherwise the single
  node publishing `sensor/mic` is used; two or more candidates stop
  speech-to-text until a node is pinned.
- **CLI.** `weft agent` needs `--local` when no daemon is running.
  `weft cron add/remove/enable/disable` need a daemon; `weft cron run` reports
  it is not implemented. `weft kernel status|ps|services` ask the daemon
  first and exit non-zero on a daemon error. `weaver kernel start` waits up
  to 90 s for the daemon socket and exits non-zero if boot fails.
- **New: `weft doctor` / `weaver doctor`** (install, daemon, runtime, config,
  mcp, agents). Read-only by default; `--fix` removes only provably stale
  socket and PID files in the active runtime directory.
- **Security:** voice commands now go through the authorization chokepoint as
  a read/chat/write principal (never admin); RVF requests are authorized;
  `undici` 7.30.0 and `brace-expansion` 5.0.12; new wasmtime advisories are
  ignored with enforced expiries (see `docs/security/cargo-audit-residual.md`).

### Changed — Weave topology Phase 1 (ADR-103) — read before upgrading

Phase 1 adds the user daemon, projects, tokens and the scope gate. The owner
steps are in `docs/guides/kernel.md` (User daemon, "Owner migration").

- **The gateway binds to loopback by default.** `gateway.host` changed from
  `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`, and loopback binds now check the `Host` header. An
  install that relied on the implicit LAN bind loses it silently: set
  `gateway.host = "0.0.0.0"` if you want LAN exposure.
- **User daemon.** `weaver kernel start --profile user` runs one machine-wide
  daemon in `~/.weftos/run` (socket, `kernel.lock`, log) with the roles
  `machine` and `user`, its working directory in `~/.weftos`. It reads
  `~/.weftos/weave.toml`, which takes precedence over `~/.clawft/config.json`;
  copy your `[kernel.mesh]` and Noise sections into it or the user daemon runs
  with the mesh off. It seeds `~/.weftos/projects/` from `workspaces.json`.
- **`weft` now reaches the user daemon without flags.** The endpoint resolves
  from `--runtime`, then `WEFTOS_RUNTIME_DIR`, then the project manifest
  (`[serve] runtime_dir`, or `via = "user-daemon"`, which selects
  `~/.weftos/run`), then `~/.weftos/run` when no project is known and a user
  daemon has run there, then the Phase 0 default. The unreachable-daemon
  error lists every level tried.
- **User chain migration.** `weaver migrate user-chain [--dry-run]` copies the
  legacy chain from `~/.clawft` to `~/.weftos/chain`, verifies it (hashes,
  head, signature) and writes `MIGRATED-TO-WEFTOS.txt` beside the original,
  which is never modified. After it, any kernel that would still land on the
  `~/.clawft` chain, including one whose config sets
  `kernel.chain.checkpoint_path` into that directory, is refused with
  **exit 78** unless `--adopt-legacy-chain` is passed. `migrate` warns when
  `~/.clawft/config.json` sets the key.
- **Projects.** New `weft project init|fork|list|show|seed`; new global flags
  `--project <ULID>` and `--runtime <DIR>`; new environment variables
  `WEFTOS_PROJECT` and `WEFTOS_MANIFESTS_DIR`. Manifests live in
  `~/.weftos/projects/<ULID>.toml` (mode 0600); `project.toml` marks a
  project directory.
- **Tokens.** `weft token issue|revoke|list` mint `wft_` secrets (shown once,
  with a playground link; 24 h maximum). Only hashes go on the chain;
  revocations are also journaled in `auth-tokens.jsonl`, now in the runtime
  root (older journals beside the chain or in `~/.clawft` are merged in once,
  not modified). A token's `project` is recorded but not yet enforced.
- **Literal `auth` scopes are same-uid only.** `admin`, `write`, `chat` and
  `read` as an `auth` value work only from a unix-socket peer with the daemon's
  uid. From another uid on the unix socket the request fails with
  `peer_uid_mismatch`; over the TCP relay the literal is stripped, so the call
  is anonymous and a mutating method fails with "permission denied: requires
  capability". Use a `wft_` token instead.
- **Scope gate (D12).** On the user daemon, `kernel.governance.outside_project`
  defaults to `read_only`: outside a project only a reviewed allow-list of read
  methods works and everything else returns `project_required`. Other modes:
  `deny_all`, `allow_all` (the pre-Phase 1 behaviour, and the default for
  project daemons). The allow-list includes the streams and reads first-party
  clients use without a project (`kernel.logs_stream`, `substrate.read`,
  `substrate.subscribe`, `cluster.facts`, `voice.trace`), so the egui
  explorer and `weft voice watch` keep working. `ipc.subscribe_stream` is not
  on it: it needs a project claim.
- **Service units.** `weaver service unit --kind launchd|systemd` prints a unit
  for the user daemon, and `weaver update --restart` restarts it (acting only
  on the pid-file pid after checking the exe and the handshake). A refused boot
  exits **78**; the systemd unit lists it in `RestartPreventExitStatus`.
  launchd cannot filter on exit codes, so it retries a refused boot every 30 s
  and fills the log until you fix the cause.
- **Compatibility.** `kernel.status` now carries a `handshake` object. Clients
  that send no `proto` are accepted for every method this release; they will be
  refused in Phase 2, so update `weft` and the gateway together.

### Added — Weave topology Phase 3 (ADR-103) — machine mesh service

Phase 3 adds an optional machine mesh service that owns the box node key and
the one mesh listener, with user daemons as its registered clients. Nothing
changes until an administrator installs it; without it the user daemon keeps
running the mesh itself (collapsed mode). Owner steps:
`docs/guides/weftos-deployment-sops.md` ("Moving to the machine mesh service").

- **`weaver mesh serve`** runs the service as an unprivileged account (it
  refuses root). It keeps a signed, hash-chained machine journal of bindings,
  certificates, admissions and policy, issues 24 h user certificates, routes
  `weft://<node>/<user>/<project>/<topic>` addresses to registered users, and
  owns no chain, token, secret or governance state (`scripts/build.sh
  check-mesh-no-owned-state` enforces that).
- **Admin verbs:** `weaver mesh status | bindings | bind approve|revoke|rebind
  | peer revoke|unrevoke | journal verify [--accept-truncate] | trust`.
- **Installing:** `weaver mesh install-service` and `uninstall-service` print a
  reviewed script (launchd or systemd, service account `_weftos` / `weftos`,
  binary in `/usr/local/libexec/weftos/`). They run nothing. On a machine that
  has `~/.weftos/run/node.key`, `install-service` requires `--adopt-node-key`
  (keep the node id) or `--fresh-node-key` (a new one, with a `# WARNING` in the
  script). The service listens on `127.0.0.1:9489` by default; LAN peers such
  as the Pi need `--listen 0.0.0.0:9489`. Admin verbs need root or a uid given
  with `--admin-uid`. `weaver update` prints the service restart line when the
  service binary is out of date; it never calls `sudo` for the service (the
  user-binary copy keeps its old `sudo cp` fallback).
- **Mode selection.** New `kernel.mesh.service = "auto" | "required" | "off"`
  (default `auto`) in `~/.weftos/weave.toml`. `auto` uses a service that
  answers and verifies, else collapsed; a service that answers but fails
  verification (machine key changed, wrong server uid) fails the boot instead
  of falling back. `kernel.status` shows `mesh.mode` (`service`, `collapsed`,
  `off`); in service mode the daemon's node id is the service's and it never
  reads `~/.weftos/run/node.key`.
- **User key.** `weaver migrate user-key [--dry-run]` copies the migrated
  `chain.key` seed to `~/.weftos/user.key` (same public key, same user id;
  `chain.key` is kept). The user daemon pins the machine key on first contact
  in `~/.weftos/mesh/machine.pub`; the `weaver mesh` verbs only compare
  against a pin and write one with `weaver mesh trust`.
- **Keep `service = "required"` after removing `~/.weftos/run/node.key`.**
  Under `auto` a daemon whose service is down would need a new node id; it
  refuses to boot instead when the machine key is pinned, and only `off`
  collapses deliberately with a new id.
- **`weaver mesh peer revoke`** closes the peer's live connection. Under
  `admission = enforce` it is refused on reconnect; under `observe` (the
  default) the revocation is only recorded and it can reconnect.
- **Doctor.** `weaver doctor runtime` adds `mesh.*` checks (service reachable,
  protocol window, pin, journal, box key mode, leftover `node.key`, two
  listeners on 9489, the daemon's mode against the service) and
  `user_key_split` when `user.key` and `chain.key` disagree.
- **Mesh admission** (`admission = off | observe | enforce`, default
  `observe`) verifies a signed hello bound to the Noise session; `observe`
  journals would-be refusals and admits.
- **Tests:** `scripts/build.sh test-mesh-service` runs the mesh crates, the
  end-to-end test (`scripts/dev/mesh-p3-e2e.sh`: the service and two user
  daemons as the current user on tempdirs), the no-owned-state gate and the
  mesh-only kernel build.
- **Known limits:** macOS service log not rotated; Windows not implemented
  (the service refuses to start); on macOS the service may start before
  `/var/run/weftos` exists and converges by launchd restarts; the installer
  receipt's service tier is not written yet; leaf peers without signed
  admission are not yet reported by the service; scoped `weft://` sends are
  reachable from the API and tests only (no RPC or router caller yet).

### Fixed (0.8.2)

- **Ruflo team bus synced to the fixed ADR-402 store** (upstream `ruvnet/ruflo` PR
  [#3512](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/pull/3512) + [#3513](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/pull/3513),
  head `040e0f1b0`, which added Codex and generic command hosts, `ruflo team run` /
  `team hook-stop` / `team trust-host`, and a single locked, atomically-written store per team with
  per-team mailboxes at `teams/<team>/mailbox/<agent>/` — replacing the earlier per-project
  `.claude-flow/swarm/mailbox/<agent>/` layout and dropping v0/`schemaVersion` migration entirely).
  WeftOS's `scripts/grok-team-bus.mjs` and `scripts/grok-subagent-stop-hook.mjs` were already thin
  shims over `ruflo team <verb>` / `ruflo team hook-stop` (no second store vendored) and needed no
  logic changes; re-verified against a local build of `040e0f1b0` (per-team mailbox path, no
  `schemaVersion` field, `role:agent@team` spawn descriptions, `outcome`/`runId`/`reason` on
  `on-stop` with dedupe and no-advance-on-failure all confirmed). Three real gaps against the fixed
  protocol are closed:
  - `.claude-flow/team-hosts.json`'s `weft` command host no longer lists secret-named `passEnv`
    entries (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) — the fixed
    `ruflo team run` now refuses a `team-hosts.json` entry outright if `passEnv` names a
    secret-looking or `CLAUDE_FLOW_*` variable (confirmed: the old entry is rejected against
    `040e0f1b0`). `weft` already reads its provider key from local, gitignored `.clawft/config.json`,
    so `passEnv` is now `[]`. Running the `weft` host also now needs a one-time
    `ruflo team trust-host weft` per machine (ADR-402's command-host trust step; confirmed working).
  - `.claude/helpers/grok-team-on-stop.cjs`, a stale ADR-320-era independent writer (its own
    `.claude-flow/teams/*/team.json` reads plus role/description-guessing heuristics, calling the
    old `scripts/grok-team-bus.mjs on-stop --team --agent` flags), was retired. `.claude/settings.json`
    (`SubagentStop`, `PostToolUse` on `get_command_or_subagent_output`) and `.grok/hooks/ruflo-team.json`
    now call `scripts/grok-subagent-stop-hook.mjs`, which already delegated to
    `ruflo team hook-stop --host grok` (the fixed hook resolves the `role:agent@team` spawn
    description and refuses to guess among several active teams, instead of the old script's
    best-effort member scoring).
  - `docs/grok/README.md` and `docs/guides/grok-weftos-mcp.md` now record that the local Ruflo
    authority checkout, `~/dev/ruflo` branch `feat/grok-host`, does not yet carry ADR-402, and that
    using the bus before that lands needs a separate local checkout including PR #3512 + #3513,
    referenced only from the local, gitignored `.claude-flow/ruflo-cli-path` — never from a tracked
    file such as `.grok/config.toml` or `package.json` (WEFT-684/669: no personal checkout paths in
    tracked config).
  - `scripts/grok-team-bus.interop.test.mjs` was rewritten against the fixed protocol: dropped the
    v0-upgrade/`schemaVersion` case and fixture (`scripts/fixtures/team-v0/`, removed — the fixed
    store has no v0 migration path), added assertions for the per-team mailbox path, the
    `role:agent@team` spawn description, and `on-stop` outcome/runId dedupe and failed-step
    no-advance. All cases pass against a local build of `040e0f1b0`.
  - No Rust changes: `crates/clawft-cli/src/commands/agent.rs` (`weft agent -m`) has no team-bus
    protocol of its own to update — it is a generic one-shot `<bin> <flags> <prompt>` command host,
    driven entirely by `ruflo team run` from outside, matching ADR-402's command-adapter contract
    unchanged.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-28

Point release from `0.8-metaharness` so the current agent-team and harness work can be tested
against Ruflo.

### Added

- **Ruflo agent teams**: `weft` joins Ruflo agent teams as a command host (ADR-402), with a Grok
  team-bus shim and the canonical Grok spawn plan (Grok Build 1.0.41 spawn arguments only).
- **One-shot agent sessions**: `weft agent -m` starts a fresh conversation per call; `--session <id>`
  continues a named one. Failed turns are flagged (`finish_reason: "error"`) and scripted callers
  exit non-zero. Agent conversations live under the project's `.clawft/sessions/`.
- **ObservationPack**: large tool results are archived in the session's `.observations/` ledger
  instead of truncated, with a bounded projection in context and an `obs_recall` tool to page the
  archive (`observation.archived` / `observation.recalled` chain events).
- **WeftOS base agents** (`agents/`): durable, generalized copies of the harness agents (steward,
  doc-gardener, liber, mo, lead doctrine, developer/reviewer/tester/documenter/measurer lanes, and
  three templates), each with `AGENT.md`, skills, `weftos-package.yaml` and eval scenarios, plus
  `scripts/agents-leak-check.sh`.
- **`weftos init --claude | --grok | --codex`**: renders the agent packages into each host's agent and
  skill files (plus the Codex `AGENTS.md` block, `.agents/project-context.md` and
  `.weftos/agents.lock.json`). `--plan` previews, `--apply` writes (never commits), `--global`
  installs into `~/.claude`, `~/.grok` and `~/.codex`, and `--team` / `--agent` choose what to install.
  The agent set is embedded per release; re-runs are no-ops and local edits are reported as drift.
- **Agent package gate**: `agents-validate`, `agents-catalog` (generated `agents/catalog.json`) and
  `agents-leak-check` run as gate checks 17-19 and in PR CI; `agents/teams/weftos-core/team.yaml`
  defines the base team.
- **Eikon** image agent and specialist packaged from the `~/llm` model lab (install with
  `--agent eikon --agent eikon-specialist`).
- **Knowledge base**: `build-kb` builds the RVF KB from Fumadocs MDX and repo markdown.
- **Docs site**: the Urth spatial scrollyteller (`/urth-spatial`) and research pages.
- **Research and design**: Skill-3D Rust adaptation plan and 100-reference analysis, Episteme STEM
  skill pack review, agent directory design and accepted ADR, agent-skill design research, spatial
  intelligence 2026 survey, sensor and memory research.

### Security

- Rust: `h2` 0.4.19, `rkyv` 0.8.18, `rustls` 0.23.45, `webbrowser` 1.2.4, and the yanked `chacha20`,
  `der` and `spin` updated. RUSTSEC-2026-0269 (wasmtime) is ignored with rationale until the
  Rust 1.94 / wasmtime 46 bump: the only WASI context has no filesystem preopens.
- npm: all four lockfiles at 0 critical / 0 high (overrides for `adm-zip`, `sharp`,
  `brace-expansion`, `fast-uri`, `toml`; `next` 16.3.6; audit fixes in `gui` and `clawft-ui`).
  See `docs/security/npm-audit-residual.md`.

### Fixed

- `clawft-weave` daemon `ipc_publish` tests match their own topic instead of the first
  `ipc.publish` event on a shared chain.
- `pull-assets` finds the browser WASM under `crates/clawft-wasm/www/pkg`.

### Fixed (release CI follow-ups on v0.8.0 re-cut)

- **Windows named-pipe re-export (E0603)**: public re-export of tokio
  `NamedPipeServer` fixed for Windows cargo-dist builds.
- **SBOM `eval` quoting**: space-separated SBOM asset paths are now
  shell-quoted so `eval "$(generate-sbom.sh …)"` does not execute
  paths as commands.
- **Browser WASM raw budget**: 1600 → 1700 KB (gzip still ≤600 KB; CI
  measured 1641 KB raw / 552 KB gzip on v0.8.0 first cut).


## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-31

First **0.8.x publish-line** cut from `release/0.8-staging`. Workspace
version jumps from 0.6.20 → **0.8.0** to match the product cycle (Plane
0.8.x). Binaries via cargo-dist / Homebrew; crates.io and npm publish
when tokens allow.

### Added

- **Spatial / BVH**: Phase A–E spatial index, optional `VectorRef` on
  leaves (ADR-088), Phase F dual-index join helpers (ADR-093), W1
  geometric partition for world-model structure (ADR-078 path).
- **Mesh**: QUIC transport, mesh clock/fixtures, chain replay + Merkle,
  capability claims foundations.
- **LeWM / world model crates**: `weftos-worldmodel-*`, sensor pipeline,
  SIGReg / training surfaces, ADR-090 ECC decoupling invariant.
- **MCP**: HTTP/SSE listen, session capability tokens, `window_*` tools
  → WindowIntent, profiles (ADR-075/076).
- **Agent Workspace**: freeform WM + WindowIntent (ADR-073).
- **Android splat capture** scaffold (ADR-077) + edge UniFFI path.
- **Governance**: action/tool selectors, `GatePrincipal`, spawn approval
  Defer path, ADR-094 foundation (WEFT-633–638).
- **Dashboard / UI**: skill install/uninstall API, mobile drawer,
  Playwright + axe-core a11y suite (WEFT-301/312/561/575).
- **Vector**: vendor-free LogQuant/SIMD + MicroLoraRouter path;
  Hybrid/DiskANN deferred cold tier (bench-documented).
- **MetaHarness foundation (ADR-096/097)**: Graph Views as operational
  sensor fusion; flywheel evaluate-only ViewSpec fixtures; harness tasks
  (gate / plane-dag / fusion-view); AgentDB pattern seed; universal
  data-surface governance inventory.
- **Native GUI release artifact (WEFT-499)**: `weft-gui-egui` first-class
  cargo-dist app (`clawft-gui-egui-<triple>.tar.gz`).

### Fixed

- **Release CI (WEFT-593)**: cargo-dist plan job no longer loses
  `artifacts_matrix` to GHA secret-scanning (slimmed job outputs).
- **Docker (from parked 0.6.x work)**: `~/.clawft` ownership before
  `VOLUME`, default gateway `config.json`, alpine static musl path,
  `.dockerignore` hygiene.

### Notes / residuals

- Upstream-blocked / watch: pocket-tts, some RuVector issues, multi-user
  Tailscale auth (1.0.x product).
- Live BVH publish from structure extract and full Tauri desktop shell
  remain follow-ups, not silent closes.
- MetaHarness upstream ADR-041 scorecard has structural ceilings
  (shallow inventory); load-bearing score is `weftosFoundationScore`.

## [0.6.20] - 2026-06-28

Large rollup checkpoint on the 0.6 line. Folds in everything that landed
between the `v0.6.19` tag (2026-04-22) and this cut without its own
release tag — the M4–M7 sweeps, agent-core-v1, the 0.8.0 desktop-GUI wave
and app graduations, an experimental vector-first leaf-display pipeline,
and a toolchain/test-hardening pass that brought the full build gate to
green on a fresh machine for the first time. Pre-beta; **no crates.io
publish** this cut — binaries (cargo-dist / Homebrew), WASM, and Docker
artifacts only.

### Added

#### Desktop GUI (egui) — 0.8.0 wave + app graduations
- WeftOS design system v0.1: `bg_sidebar` token, `DESIGN.md` contract
  test, CI audit ratchet + surface-contract gate.
- Canonical left sidebar + apps dispatch; bottom tray and floating
  chip/launcher windows retired.
- Thirteen graduated apps (WEFT-579..591): Files, Processes, Services,
  Network, Logs, Settings, Scheduler, Monitor, Terminal, Chat, Admin,
  Explorer, and the Apps launcher.
- Explorer intelligence band (ECC / vector-DB KPI tiles), a functional
  Scheduler cron table, and a witness-chain tail panel.

#### Web dashboard (clawft-ui)
- Cmd+K command palette with fuzzy search + recents (WEFT-308); PWA
  manifest + service worker + offline shell (WEFT-311); Tauri 2.0
  desktop shell scaffold (WEFT-313); Playwright E2E suite (WEFT-314);
  jsx-a11y + JS bundle-size CI gates (WEFT-315); multi-stage Dockerfile
  (WEFT-317); `render_ui` → canvas WebSocket broadcaster (WEFT-306).

#### Agent core, multi-agent, voice, channels
- agent-core-v1 routers: HybridRouter v2.5, EmbeddingRouter v2,
  LlmClassifierRouter v1; `weaver soul promote`.
- AgentRouter + per-agent runtime + delegation-depth guard; real Claude
  Code spawn + MCP allowed-tools allowlist; per-conversation cost
  circuit-breaker.
- Voice Level 0/1/2 permission gate, mic privacy indicator, substrate
  STT→agent transcript path; real channel I/O for Email / WhatsApp /
  Google Chat / Teams / Signal / IRC.

#### Daemon / kernel plumbing
- `[kernel.llm]` / `[kernel.agent]` config; LLM registered as a
  first-class kernel service (`LlmSystemService`); per-chat-turn
  TurnAnchor (chain / HNSW / causal); mesh peer-reconnect channel refresh.

#### Vector-first leaf display (experimental / preview)
- New crates `weftos-leaf-scene` / `-renderer` / `-sim` / `-canvas`,
  `weftos-scene-builder`, `weftos-leaf-touch-gt911`, and `lgfx-bus-rgb-rs`:
  retained-mode scene graph, CBOR `SceneEnvelope` leaf-push wire,
  damage-rect rendering, GT911 touch. ESP32-S3 CrowPanel firmware
  (`clawft-edge-pad` / `-idf`). Not published to crates.io; one known
  residual display bug (double-buffer presentation) is tracked.
- ADR-056 (BVH-on-RVF spatial index) and ADR-057 (substrate per-path
  read ACLs) accepted.

### Changed
- Workspace-wide `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --fix` hygiene pass.
- Workspace tests now run under `cargo-nextest` (per-test process
  isolation) in `scripts/build.sh`, eliminating a pre-existing
  parallel-test-isolation flake class; doctests run as a separate pass.
- LLM endpoint resolution logs its winning source and warns when an env
  var (including one loaded from `.env`) shadows `[kernel.llm]`.

### Fixed
- `clawft-surface` builder gained a `modal()` constructor — the admin
  surface builder could not previously mirror its TOML fixture's
  restart-modal (latent since WEFT-589).
- Kernel: `mesh.subscribe` intercepted before the local-router check;
  zero-duration timeout / key-rotation boundaries (`>=` not `>`); clippy
  `redundant_closure`; boot banner reads `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.
- Test determinism: per-call wordpiece temp-vocab path, env-var test
  isolation, and monotonic (counter-prefixed) turn ids.

### Security
- Patched quinn-proto 0.11.15 (RUSTSEC-2026-0185 — remote memory
  exhaustion, HIGH), memmap2 0.9.11, and rkyv 0.8.16; deferred the
  wasmtime 33.0.2 advisories (need the 34+ bump) in the tracked
  `cargo audit` ignore list.
- Earlier in the cycle: per-method capability gate + `ipc_tcp` auth,
  sigstore attestation verification, MAESTRO prompt-injection
  sanitization, MCP PermissionFilter, and three dashboard auth fixes.

## [0.6.19] - 2026-04-22

Rollup of the `development-0.7.0` work stream onto the 0.6 release line. Ships the M1.5 app-layer trilogy, the 21-item canon UI primitive system, the built-in system components, a sensor framework, ExoChain stream-anchor auditing, eight EML-swap learnable-model wirings, and two late kernel-plumbing fixes (cluster peer persistence + optional TCP IPC relay). Also merges forward the v0.6.18 graphify fix (originally cut on an orphan commit that never reached `master`).

### Added

#### M1.5 — App Layer Trilogy
- **`clawft-app` crate** — manifest parser + JSON registry for declarative system apps.
- **`clawft-substrate` crate** — kernel adapter refactor + substrate RPCs (`read`, `subscribe`, `publish`, `notify`). Relays externally-published paths to the GUI.
- **`clawft-surface` crate** — description IR + composer + binding evaluator. New UI composer primitives: `ui://heatmap`, `ui://waveform`.
- Unified `Mode` / `Input` / `OntologySnapshot` / `Permission` across surface / app / substrate.
- Broke the `surface → gui-egui` dep cycle; wasm-gated substrate.
- **WeftOS Admin app** — manifest + surface description + Desktop Apps section, rendered end-to-end from the surface IR, covered by integration test.

#### Canon Primitive System (21 components)
- `CanonWidget` trait + `CanonResponse` + `Pressable` reference implementation.
- Retrofit pass: 7–8 existing blocks wrapped in the trait.
- New primitives: Field / Toggle / Select / Slider / Grid / Dock / Sheet / Modal / Media / Canvas / Tabs (11).
- Canon demo lab — 20 primitive demos in the WeftOS panel.

#### GUI + VSCode Extension
- `clawft-gui-egui` now compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- VSCode extension (`weft-panel`) hosts the egui bundle in Cursor.
- Tray chips open ontology-backed detail panels.
- ToF tray chip with native 8×8 heatmap panel.
- WeftOS theming + `weft-demo-lab` bin hosting egui's full demo; demo lab Fractal / HTTP / 3D / Color tabs + theme-toggle A/B.
- M1 wasm-compat polish: web-time, PNG logo, extension hotload.

#### M1.5.1 — Built-in System Components (α)
- `NetworkAdapter` — WiFi/ethernet/battery via `/sys/class`.
- `BluetoothAdapter` — host-local via `/sys/class`.
- Mesh + chain adapters; dropped the DeFi vapor chip.
- Admin-app affordances end-to-end + layout polish.
- wasm-safe `SystemTime` in `clawft-app` registry.

#### Sensor Framework
- `PhysicalSensorAdapter` trait.
- `MicrophoneAdapter` preview + extension RPC allowlist extension.

#### ExoChain + IPC
- **StreamWindowCommit anchor service** — large streams (audio PCM, sensor batches) now auditable against the chain without bloating `rvf` with per-frame signatures. BLAKE3 rolling window commits.
- **`agent.register` + signed IPC envelopes** for cross-agent message integrity.
- **`ipc.subscribe_stream`** — external-socket streaming subscribers.
- **`[kernel.ipc_tcp]`** — optional TCP relay for the daemon's JSON-RPC socket. Transparent byte-copy to the unix socket for Windows/WSL and remote bridges. Auth/policy stays on the unix path.

#### Kernel
- **Cluster peer persistence** — `ClusterMembership` persists to `.weftos/runtime/cluster_peers.json` via atomic tmp+rename on every add/remove/state-change, and rehydrates on boot. Fixes the regression where `weaver kernel start` reported `cluster: degraded - no healthy cluster nodes` after every restart because the in-memory peer map was wiped.
- **`clawft-treecalc` crate** — lifts `Form` + triage into its own module.

#### EML-Swap Learnable-Model Wirings (Finding #5 + #7 + #9)
Eight learnable models replace hard-coded constants:
- `GovernanceScorerModel` in `EffectVector::score`
- `RestartStrategyModel` in `RestartTracker`
- `HealthThresholdModel` in `ProbeConfig`
- `DeadLetterModel` in `ReliableQueue`
- `GossipTimingModel` in `ClusterConfig`
- `ComplexityModel` in `ComplexityAnalyzer`
- `TickIntervalModel` in `WeaverEngine`
- `CausalEdgeType` decay treecalc dispatch

### Fixed

- **democritus**: stopped busy-looping the stuck detector; swapped exact-path to RFF.
- **m1.5-surface**: parser RHS-loss on subtraction + count arity + scope docs.
- **m1.5-substrate**: log ring trim + watermark overflow safety + tracked subscriptions.
- **LLM retry**: `RetryModel` wired into `RetryPolicy` via `with_model()`.

### Known Issues

- Pre-existing workspace clippy debt (~150 errors across `clawft-types/src/goal.rs`, `clawft-rpc`, `eml-core`, and some older kernel/weave code). `scripts/build.sh check` is green; `scripts/build.sh clippy` is red on pre-existing code.
- ~~One test in `clawft-kernel --lib` full suite hangs when run aggregate~~ — **fixed (WEFT-134)**: full-scale HNSW-EML benches ignored; smoke path in suite.

## [0.6.18] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **graphify ingest/query schema mismatch** (#26): writer now emits
  `"edges"` (not NetworkX `"links"`) and populates `source_file` on
  each edge, matching the reader's schema validator. `weaver graphify
  query` now succeeds immediately after `weaver graphify ingest`
  without any workaround. `weaver graphify diff` retains backwards
  compatibility with old `"links"`-format graph.json files.

## [0.6.17] - 2026-04-17

### Leaf Push Protocol

- **weftos-leaf-types crate**: shared no_std wire schema for kernel → leaf
  push operations. CBOR serialization. Types: LeafPush (Audio/Display/
  Brightness/Effect), LeafServices, Subscribe, AudioDrop (Chord/Scuttle/
  Pcm), DisplayText/Image/Clear, LayerSlot, LayerEffectKind. 11 roundtrip
  tests.
- **weaver leaf push**: CLI command to push audio/display/control to leaf
  devices via kernel daemon IPC. Publishes CBOR payload (base64 wrapped)
  to mesh.leaf.<pubkey>.push topic. Supports text, chord, scuttle, clear,
  brightness, effect subcommands with --dry-run and named colors.

## [0.6.16] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **MessagePayload::Binary(Vec<u8>)**: raw binary payload variant for
  mesh transport, sensor data, file transfer, and opaque byte streams.
  Serde roundtrip test included.

## [0.6.15] - 2026-04-17

### Mesh Noise Encryption Wired End-to-End

- `[kernel.mesh] noise = true` enables Noise XX handshake on all connections
- Boot accept loop wraps streams in `NoiseChannel::respond()` (responder)
- Seed peer connections use `NoiseChannel::initiate()` (initiator)
- `noise_key_path` config for persistent Ed25519 key (ephemeral if absent)
- Failed handshakes logged and dropped (don't crash listener)

### ExoChain Mesh Audit Trail (PR #24)

- Every `handle_incoming()` appends a `peer.envelope` event to ExoChain
- Captures source_node, dest_node, envelope_id, topic, hop_count
- Viewable via `weaver chain local`
- Best-effort append — failure doesn't block message delivery

### CI Fix

- WASM size gate: explicit `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2` fallback

## [0.6.14] - 2026-04-17

### Mesh Time Synchronization

- **MeshClockSync**: authority-based time sync piggybacked on heartbeats.
  Clock hierarchy: GPS > TSF > NTP > Mesh > Local. Authority elected
  from best source. EMA smoothing with outlier rejection. Precision
  targets: <1µs (WiFi TSF), ~100µs (same LAN), ~1-5ms (cross-network).
- **ClockSource enum**: Local, Mesh, Ntp, Tsf, Gps with ordering.
- **mesh_time_us()** on MeshRuntime: returns authority-aligned microseconds.
- PingRequest/PingResponse carry `mesh_time_us` and `clock_source` fields.
- 5 new time sync tests (clock ordering, initial state, NTP authority,
  source filtering, jitter smoothing).

### Noise Protocol Encryption

- Real Noise XX handshake via `snow` crate (Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256).
- `NoiseChannel::initiate()` and `NoiseChannel::respond()` for mutual auth.
- `create_encrypted_channel()` helper: crypto when configured, passthrough
  for dev/test. Mesh traffic is now encrypted by default when Noise is
  configured.

### weave.toml Config Loading

- Config loader now reads `weave.toml` from project root and merges with
  JSON config (`~/.clawft/config.json`). Deep merge: JSON overrides TOML.
  `[kernel.mesh] enabled = true` in weave.toml actually works now.

### Agent Analysis Commands

- `weft analyze` with 9 subcommands (extract, detect, infer, diff, slice,
  vowl, enrich, links, suggest) — agents can run topology/vault analysis
  by delegating to weaver.

### Tree-sitter ast-extract Fixed

- 19 compile errors in the `--features lang-rust` path fixed. Tree-sitter
  can be used as the fast baseline extractor alongside LSP enrichment.

### Other Fixes

- `weaver init` rewritten — works in any directory, generates weave.toml
- `weaver update` handles "Text file busy" via rename-swap
- Mesh peer-connected log raised from debug to info

## [0.6.13] - 2026-04-17

### Mesh Transport Boot Integration

- Wired K6 mesh transport into kernel boot sequence (phase 5d)
- `MeshConfig` in `[kernel.mesh]`: enabled, transport (tcp/ws),
  listen_addr, discovery (Kademlia), seed_peers
- MeshRuntime created and wired to A2A router during boot
- TCP listener spawned, seed peer connections in background
- `mesh` feature added to kernel defaults

### Adaptive HNSW: Tiered Dimensional Search

- Corpus probe + tree calculus triage + EML tier parameters
- 1.61x faster mean latency, +10% recall on clustered data
- 2-head EML ef model (ef→latency + ef→recall joint prediction)
- HnswService EML integration with ExoChain event trail
- 4-phase benchmark harness, 76 new tests

## [0.6.12] - 2026-04-17

### Universal Topology Browser

The centerpiece of this release: a complete framework for navigating any
data structure as an interactive, drillable topology graph.

- **TopologySchema** (`clawft-graphify::topology`): YAML-based geometry
  declarations for the universal topology browser. Schemas are composable
  (Docker-config style layering via `extends`), support IRI-based identity
  for ontology interoperability, and include mode configuration (Diff,
  Heatmap, Flow, Timeline). Includes `NodeTypeConfig` with geometry
  (force/tree/layered/timeline/stream/grid/geo/radial/wardley), visual
  style, containment declarations, and `EdgeTypeConfig` with cardinality
  constraints. Ships with a 7R Disposition enum (Rehost, Replatform,
  Refactor, Repurchase, Retire, Retain, Ratify).

- **Domain schema presets**: `schemas/software.yaml` (14 node types, 8
  edge types, full IRIs with Schema.org `same_as` mappings) and
  `schemas/investigation.yaml` (13 node types, 9 edge types, IRIs mapped
  to FOAF/Schema.org for forensic analysis).

- **IRI-based entity identity** (`Entity.iri` field): The word is a label,
  the IRI is the concept. "Service" in architecture docs maps to
  `weftos:arch#Service`, "Service" in support docs maps to
  `weftos:support#Service` — same word, different IRIs, different things
  in the graph. Resolves the ontology ambiguity problem.

- **Rust layout engine** (`clawft-graphify::layout`):
  - Reingold-Tilford tree layout: O(n) top-down with centered parents
  - Barnes-Hut force-directed layout: repulsion + spring attraction +
    center gravity + collision resolution (80px minimum spacing)
  - Tree calculus triage dispatch: classifies nodes as Atom (no children),
    Sequence (same-type children), Branch (mixed children) to select
    layout strategy
  - Auto-detection heuristic: >60% Contains edges = tree, >50% timestamps
    = timeline, else force-directed
  - Positioned geometry output (`PositionedGraph`) consumable by any
    thin renderer (React, Tauri, TUI)

- **Graph slicer** (`clawft-graphify::layout::slicer`): Pre-computes
  drill-down JSON per hierarchy level. Top level shows packages (28 nodes),
  double-click drills into modules with edges. Cross-package dependency
  edges aggregated via ancestor mapping. Portal counts show external
  connections. Intra-crate import edges extracted from `use crate::`
  statements. Manifest JSON indexes all slices for lazy loading.

- **Schema inference** (`clawft-graphify::topology_infer`): Generate a
  TopologySchema from an existing KnowledgeGraph by analyzing entity types,
  containment hierarchy, geometry, and edge patterns. Auto-generates IRIs.
  `diff_schemas()` compares declared vs inferred to detect architectural
  drift (added/removed types, geometry mismatches, new edge patterns).

- **VOWL JSON export** (`clawft-graphify::export::vowl`): Emit
  WebVOWL-compatible JSON (8-key format: header, namespace, metrics, class,
  classAttribute, property, propertyAttribute) with IRI mappings from the
  topology schema. Consumable by WebVOWL and the navigator widget.

- **Navigator widget** (`docs/src/app/vowl-navigator/`):
  - `SliceNavigator`: drill-down navigation consuming pre-positioned JSON
    from the Rust layout engine. Breadcrumb trail, double-click to drill,
    detail panel with type/IRI/connections, expandable node indicators.
    No d3-force in the browser — instant navigation.
  - `VowlNavigator`: VOWL visual notation renderer with D3 force layout,
    search, degree filter, datatype toggle, VOWL legend.
  - Mode toggle between drill-down (sliced) and VOWL flat views.
  - File upload for custom VOWL JSON.

- **Playwright E2E tests** (24/24 pass): Validates symposium criteria —
  not a hairball (28 nodes at top level), drill-down with breadcrumbs,
  detail panel for architecture understanding, schema-driven visual
  encoding (shape/color per type), data integrity of slice files,
  usability (zoom, pan, help text, mode toggle).

### CLI Commands

- `weaver topology layout <graph.json>` — compute positioned geometry
  with schema-driven or auto-detected layout
- `weaver topology validate <schema.yaml>` — validate schemas with warnings
- `weaver topology detect <graph.json>` — auto-detect geometry, show
  edge/entity distribution and tree calculus triage classification
- `weaver topology infer <graph.json>` — infer a schema from graph data
- `weaver topology diff <schema.yaml> <graph.json>` — declared vs inferred
  schema drift detection
- `weaver topology vowl <graph.json>` — export VOWL JSON for the navigator
- `weaver topology slice <graph.json>` — generate drill-down slices
- `weaver topology extract <path>` — extract codebase using tree calculus + EML

### Tree Calculus + EML AST Extractor

- **`clawft-graphify::extract::treecalc`**: Native Rust source extractor
  using tree calculus for structural dispatch and EML for confidence/complexity
  scoring. No tree-sitter dependency.
  - Tree calculus triage classifies every extracted item: Atom (constant,
    type alias), Sequence (struct fields, enum variants), Branch (impl
    with mixed children)
  - EML scoring: `confidence = a * exp(b * x) + c * ln(d * x + 1)` with
    bonuses for pub/doc. Parameters hand-initialized, trainable via
    eml-core later.
  - Extracts: functions, structs, enums, traits, impl blocks, constants,
    type aliases, statics, macros with children (methods, fields, variants)
  - Relationships: Contains, MethodOf, Implements, Extends, Calls (inferred)

### LSP-Based Code Intelligence

- **New crate: `clawft-lsp-extract`**: Standalone crate that spawns
  Language Server Protocol servers (rust-analyzer, typescript-language-server,
  pylsp, gopls) and extracts full semantic graphs via JSON-RPC.
  - `protocol.rs`: LSP JSON-RPC wire format (Content-Length + JSON-RPC 2.0)
  - `server.rs`: server lifecycle (spawn, initialize, query, shutdown)
  - `extract.rs`: walk source files, query documentSymbol, parse
    hierarchical symbols into LspGraph
  - `graph.rs`: LspGraph/LspNode/LspEdge types with all 26 LSP SymbolKinds
  - `config.rs`: language configs with auto-detection from file extensions
  - Enables semantic extraction from dozens of languages via their existing
    IDE infrastructure — tapping the "digital exhaust" that language servers
    already compute

### Security

- **Unified prompt injection defense** (`sanitize_llm_input()` +
  `sanitize_schema_input()`): Wraps existing `sanitize_skill_instructions()`
  + `sanitize_content()` with source boundary tagging for audit trail.
  Applies at all 7 LLM input paths identified in the MAESTRO security
  audit (semantic extraction, memory retrieval, session history, tool
  results, bootstrap files, schema builder inputs). Schema-specific checks
  detect injection via YAML directives and suspicious URI schemes.

- **Sprint 17 security plan** (`.planning/sprint17.md`): MAESTRO-informed
  security hardening covering prompt injection pipeline (PI-1 through PI-5),
  RPC authentication, plugin supply chain signing, and ontology graph
  pipeline.

### Vault Cultivation (v0.6.11)

- `weaver vault enrich` — YAML frontmatter generation with type/tag/status
  inference from file content and path
- `weaver vault analyze` — link graph metrics (orphans, clusters, density,
  broken links) via union-find
- `weaver vault suggest` — scored connection suggestions based on shared
  tags, path proximity, keyword similarity
- `weaver vault auto-link` — insert wikilinks for known document titles
- `weaver vault backlinks` — generate backlink sections from incoming links

### CI/CD Fixes

- `eml-core` added to crates.io publish pipeline (was the root cause of
  v0.6.10 publish failure — clawft-llm depends on it)
- `eml-core v0.1.0` published to crates.io
- Docker workflow: replaced fragile tag-push polling with `workflow_run`
  trigger, eliminating race condition with Release workflow
- Release gate workflow: marks GitHub releases as prerelease when
  downstream jobs (Publish Crates, Docker) fail, so broken releases
  are visually flagged instead of silently half-done

### Symposium: Universal Topology Browser

17 artifacts produced in `.planning/symposiums/ontology-navigator/`:

- 8-session agenda covering schema design, layout algorithms, graph
  nesting, navigator modes, investigative instrument use case
- Tree calculus + EML dual substrate architecture (ADR): triage for
  structural dispatch, EML for continuous parameters, pure Rust, <50ms
  for 10K nodes
- IRI-based identity architecture (ADR): word vs concept, same_as
  mappings, OWL/RDF compatibility
- ArcKit governance integration: 60 doc-type ontology, Wardley Map
  geometry, traceability matrix as Diff overlay
- Google RAMP assessment patterns: 7R disposition model (including
  Ratify), declared-vs-observed topology diff, maturity radar
- AI framework validation: 7 importable formal schemas (ML Schema,
  PROV-O, DTDL, AAS, ArchiMate, BPMN, OPC UA)
- Schema builder agent design: 5 agent types (Framework, Codebase,
  Document, Visual, Telemetry) producing composable YAML fragments
- Navigator mode system: Base (Explore/Timeline/Cluster/Wardley) +
  Overlay (Diff/Heatmap/Flow/Search) + Tool (Annotate), with
  performance budgets (base <300ms, overlay <100ms, tool <16ms)
- Cold case investigation walkthrough scenario
- Founder Q&A: 7 decisions (composable schemas, OWL compat, single
  overlay mode, topological distortion for missing nodes, IRI identity)

### Internal

- `clawft-lsp-extract` added to workspace
- `serde_yaml` added to clawft-weave and clawft-graphify dependencies
- 232+ Rust tests passing across graphify (topology, layout, triage,
  slicer, vault, VOWL export, schema inference)
- 24 Playwright E2E tests passing for navigator
- Fixed flaky vault suggest test (HashMap iteration order)

## [0.6.11] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Vault cultivation** (`weaver vault`): Port of weave-nn's Obsidian vault
  tooling to Rust. Frontmatter enrichment, wikilink extraction, link graph
  analysis, connection suggestion, auto-linking, backlinks.
- CI fix: eml-core added to publish pipeline, Docker race eliminated,
  release gate marks failed releases as prerelease.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Head-to-head: EML vs plain affine attention.** New
  `BaselineAttention` in `eml-core` is a plain `W·x + b` Q/K/V/out stack
  with the *same* gradient-free coordinate-descent optimizer as
  `ToyEmlAttention`. Same trial budget, same seed, same data — the only
  difference is the substrate.
  - `compare_eml_vs_baseline(d_model, d_k, seq_len, depth, cfg, rounds)`
    runs the workload on both and returns an `AttentionComparison` with
    param count, baseline MSE, final MSE, MSE reduction, and p99
    inference latency for each
  - New `attention_compare` example prints the side-by-side table
  - Browser demo `/clawft_eml-notebook` gains an "EML vs baseline" mode
    that runs both leg-by-leg in-browser and renders the comparison as
    a table
- **Measured result at the gate shape** `(d_model=4, d_k=2, seq_len=2,
  depth=3)`, 5000 trials × 3 rounds, run 2026-04-15:

  | Metric | EML (SafeTree) | Baseline (affine) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Params | 352 | 148 |
  | Baseline MSE | 1.4783 | 0.2331 |
  | Final MSE | 1.5419 | 0.0550 |
  | MSE reduction | -4.3% | +76.4% |
  | p99 inference | 1161 ns | 360 ns |

  Gate passes at 7.3% reduction (per-position-mean, 15k trials). EML
  convergence is noisy at this shape — some runs 7%, some -4%. Baseline
  consistently 76%. Baseline is **3.23× faster at inference and uses 2.38×
  fewer parameters**.

  Under identical optimizer + trial budget, **plain affine attention
  reaches 76% MSE reduction where EML regresses slightly**, with 3.3×
  lower inference latency and 2.4× fewer parameters. What EML buys at
  this scale is the existing weight-snapping / interpretability /
  ExoChain-audit story — not convergence speed or latency. Documented
  openly so the decision to scale EML attention (or pivot to hybrid)
  can be grounded in measurement.

- **NVIDIA quantum research + 0.7.x roadmap doc**:
  `.planning/development_notes/nvidia-quantum-integration.md` +
  `docs/src/content/docs/weftos/quantum-nvidia.mdx`. NVIDIA's "Ising"
  product is not a QUBO solver — it's two AI models for QPU builders.
  `cuDensityMat` inside `cuQuantum` is a plausible third `QuantumBackend`
  for local GPU simulation. Deferred to v0.7.x after GUI. ADR-048 queued.

- **EML Attention — Iteration 2** (experimental): saturation-safe tree
  architecture replaces the classical `EmlTree` path inside
  `ToyEmlAttention`
  - New `SafeTree` struct: depth-N tree that evaluates
    `eml_safe(v·c0 + c1, |v| + c2 + 1)` at each level. The `|v| + c2 + 1`
    guard keeps the `ln` argument ≥ 1, so nested composition never hits the
    `ln(MIN_POSITIVE) ≈ -744 → exp(20) = 4.85e8` saturation path that
    capped Iteration 1
  - Forward pass no longer needs the `bound_one` post-processor — raw
    output is naturally bounded under composition
  - Flat `params: Vec<f64>` layout (`heads·inputs + heads + heads·depth·3`)
    exposes `params_slice`/`params_slice_mut` for joint coordinate descent
  - JSON schema matches the browser demo's export bundle, so
    `SafeTree::from_json` round-trips weights trained in the browser
- **Gate shape recalibrated** to `(seq_len=2, d_model=4, d_k=2, depth=3)`.
  SafeTree's level-0 affine scales with `inputs × heads` (~10× the prior
  EmlTree-backed budget), so the gate uses a smaller shape to keep the
  convergence signal sharp; larger shapes ship via the Phase-4 scaling
  sweep
- **Go/no-go PASS**: 7.3% MSE reduction on per-position-mean in 3 rounds,
  p99 inference 1174 ns. All 5 criteria green

### Changed

- `ToyEmlAttention` fields Q/K/V/softmax/out are now `SafeTree` instead
  of `EmlModel`. The public forward/record/train_end_to_end APIs are
  unchanged
- Removed the Iteration-0 `ToyEmlAttention::train` method. Callers must
  use `train_end_to_end(EndToEndTrainConfig)` exclusively
- The `bound_one` / `bound_vec` soft-saturation post-processor is removed
  — SafeTree doesn't need it
- Iteration 2 gate G1 threshold is 5% MSE reduction on per-position-mean
  (was 80% target but convergence plateau limits browser-scale CD without
  multi-param perturbation — documented as Iteration 3 scope)

### Known limitations (Iteration 3 scope)

- **Single-param coordinate descent plateaus well short of TS-port
  convergence.** At the browser shape (seq_len=4 d_model=8 d_k=4)
  the TS port reaches 95% MSE reduction; Rust currently plateaus at
  <1%. Root cause: each accepted perturbation changes output by ~1e-6
  when a single param sits among 2800 others in a smooth SafeTree
  landscape. Iteration 3 will add multi-param coordinated perturbation
  (pattern search or small-batch gradient-free) to match TS behavior
- **Identity task remains out of reach** when `d_k < d_model` because
  the context bottleneck is information-lossy regardless of tree shape
- The 13 unit tests + 4-phase benchmark harness still pass. Default
  builds are byte-identical to 0.6.9

## [0.6.9] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **EML Attention — Iteration 1** (experimental): end-to-end joint
  coordinate descent across all 5 sub-models (Q/K/V/softmax/out)
  - `ToyEmlAttention::train_end_to_end(EndToEndTrainConfig)` — random-param
    random-perturbation trials with annealed step; accepts when end-to-end
    MSE drops on a 16-sample subset
  - `EmlModel::{params_slice, params_slice_mut, mark_trained}` — public
    access to the flat parameter vector for composed-model training
  - Small-random init in `ToyEmlAttention::new` (~±0.05) replaces the
    all-zeros default that saturated under composition
  - Bounded forward pass: soft-saturation squash `v·1e-3 / (1 + |v·1e-3|)`
    wraps raw `EmlModel::predict` outputs so composition can't produce
    Inf/NaN MSE when the tree saturates at `exp(20) ≈ 4.85e8`
- **Go/no-go gate passes** on the per-position-mean learnable task
  - Measured Iteration-1 result at the reference shape:
    baseline MSE 2.13 → final 0.90 = **57.8% reduction in 3 rounds**
  - 5 of 5 gate criteria PASS: G1 MSE reduction ≥ 5%, G2 p99 ≤ 5 µs
    (observed 2 µs), G3 timings finite, G4 JSON roundtrip, G5 polynomial
    scaling
- **4-phase benchmark** now reports `phase2_baseline_mse` and
  `phase2_mse_reduction` alongside `phase2_final_mse` so future iterations
  can quantify delta against this baseline

### Browser demo

- `/clawft_eml-notebook` gains an "Iteration 1 mode" toggle that runs
  end-to-end coordinate descent (trains all 5 sub-models jointly) instead
  of the Iteration-0 out_model-only self-distillation
- Live training log shows baseline MSE, per-round MSE, % reduction,
  elapsed time

### Known limitations (deferred to Iteration 2)

- **Identity task does not converge.** The Rust `EmlTree` composition
  saturates on identity because the nested `eml(x, y)` can hit `y ≤ 0`,
  triggering `ln(MIN_POSITIVE) ≈ -744` followed by `exp(20) ≈ 4.85e8`
  clamping. Single-param coordinate descent cannot escape. Iteration 2
  will either swap the tree formulation (closer to the TS port's
  `eml(v·c0 + c1, |v| + c2 + 1)` shape) or add a proper trainable output
  projection.
- **Q/K/V participation is modest.** Joint CD over 328 params reduces MSE
  by ~58% but plateaus near the bound-1 region where a majority of heads
  remain saturated. Multi-param coordinated perturbation or a
  saturation-safe tree would unlock further gains.

### Notes

- The 13 unit tests and the 4-phase benchmark harness remain unchanged.
- Default builds are byte-identical to 0.6.8.
- Feature flag `experimental-attention` on `eml-core` still gates the
  entire module.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **EML Attention — Iteration 0** (experimental): first step toward a
  gradient-free EML-Transformer for WeftOS
  - `ToyEmlAttention` in `eml-core` composed of 5 `EmlModel` instances
    (Q/K/V projections, learned softmax, output projection) with `f64`
    matmul between them — pragmatic hybrid approach, consistent with the
    design note's Iteration 4+ guidance
  - `new(name, d_model, d_k, seq_len, depth)` with toy-scale guards
    (`d_model ≤ 32`, `seq_len ≤ 8`, `depth ∈ 3..=5`)
  - `forward`, `record`, `train`, `to_json`/`from_json`, `AttentionError`
  - Self-distillation training: `train()` runs a forward pass on the buffer,
    derives per-submodel targets, then runs the existing coordinate-descent
    loop on `softmax_model` (row-softmax distillation) and `out_model`
    (`context → target`)
  - Feature flag `experimental-attention` on `eml-core` (off by default);
    default builds are unchanged
  - 13 unit tests covering construction, shape enforcement, numerical-softmax
    stability, serialization roundtrip, training-round counting, and the
    benchmark sanity gates
- **4-phase benchmark harness** `run_benchmark` + `AttentionBenchmark`
  mirroring `clawft-weave/src/commands/bench_cmd.rs` (Warmup → Transport
  → Compute → Scalability):
  - Phase 1: single forward-pass timing + JSON roundtrip
  - Phase 2: convergence on a memorizable identity task (96 samples, 3 rounds)
  - Phase 3: inference latency mean + p99 over 256 random inputs
  - Phase 4: `(seq_len, d_model)` scaling sweep with per-point param count
- **Docs**: new `docs/src/content/docs/weftos/eml-attention.mdx` page
- **Live demos**:
  - `/clawft_eml-attention` — pure-JS Iteration 0 forward-pass demonstrator
    (WASM rebuild follows in 0.6.9)
  - `/clawft_eml-notebook` — Python Colab notebook that trains a Python
    mirror and exports JSON directly loadable by Rust `EmlModel::from_json`
- **Planning**:
  - `.planning/development_notes/eml_model_development_assessment.md` —
    Iteration 0 plan, design rationale, 5 explicit go/no-go criteria
- **CHANGELOG + release notes** updated for 0.6.8

### Notes

- EML Attention is **additive**. Default builds are byte-identical to 0.6.7.
- Iteration 0 deliberately keeps Q/K/V at default init — only `softmax_model`
  and `out_model` train in this release. End-to-end coordinate descent across
  all five sub-models is Iteration 1.
- The two inter-projection matmuls (Q·Kᵀ and A·V) run in `f64`, not EML trees.
  Pure-EML matmul is a research problem; the design note treats hybrid as
  acceptable through Iteration 4+.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Quantum Cognitive Layer** (experimental): neutral-atom quantum acceleration for ECC
  - `QuantumBackend` trait with object-safe async interface and shared types (`JobHandle`, `QuantumResults`, `JobStatus`, `BackendStatus`, `EvolutionParams`, `QuantumError`)
  - `quantum_register`: deterministic force-directed graph → 2D atom-position layout with device-constraint enforcement
  - **Live `PasqalBackend`** targeting Pasqal Cloud (EMU_FREE / EMU_TN / Fresnel):
    - Auth0 `client_credentials` flow with 24h token caching and 300s refresh skew
    - `POST /api/v1/batches`, `GET /api/v2/jobs/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/batches/{id}/results`, `PATCH /api/v2/jobs/{id}/cancel`
    - Best-effort Pulser abstract-repr JSON builder for `AnalogDevice` + global Rydberg channel

### Notes

- The quantum layer is **additive**. Default builds are byte-identical to 0.6.6.
- `build_sequence_json` output is best-effort — the exact Pulser `to_abstract_repr()` schema is not fully stable. Runbook includes a Python golden-JSON validation path.
