# agents-leak-check.sh — confidentiality denylist scan over agents/
#
# WeftOS's agents/ directory is checked into a PUBLIC repo. This script exists because
# some packages under agents/ were ported from a private client engagement repo
# (~/Clients/ctox/sansone) and generalized for reuse — see each package's
# weftos-package.yaml `provenance` block. This scan is the safety net that keeps
# client-identifying content out of agents/ going forward, on every run, not just at
# port time.
#
# Usage: scripts/agents-leak-check.sh
# Exit code: 0 = clean, non-zero = at least one denylisted pattern matched.
#
# NOTE: this script's own source necessarily contains the denylisted terms as literal
# grep patterns — that is how a denylist scanner works, the same way a secret-scanner's
# rule file contains the shape of the secrets it looks for. The terms below are named
# directly in this project's own confidentiality instructions; nothing here is content
# discovered by inspecting client material, and the script's job is exactly to keep those
# terms OUT of the files it scans.
